With the release of iOS 10 and the need to update iOS apps to suit, I have decided it is time to retire some of my lesser-performing apps as it is not worth the effort to maintain them.

At the moment, the following iOS apps are no longer available:

* A Knight's Move
* Dice Pass
* Pic-a-POD
* Quick Score - Tennis

For the first three listed there, the Mac versions are still available:

* [A Knight's Move for Mac][1]
* [Dice Pass for Mac][2]
* [Pic-a-POD for Mac][3]

If you bought any of these apps and would like a promo code for the Mac version, send me a screen shot of the app running on your iPhone or iPad and I will send you a code.
