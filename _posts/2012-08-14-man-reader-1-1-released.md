The update of [Man Reader][1] to version 1.1 has just become available through the Mac App Store. This update has a bunch of [new features][2] &#8211; thanks to everyone who made suggestions.

As detailed in a [previous post][3], there have been major issues getting this app approved with Apple&#8217;s new sand-boxing restrictions fully in place. But to their credit, the Apple reviewers have been unfailing helpful and polite in answering my questions and keeping me informed.

I hope everyone finds the new features useful. Please [keep the suggestions coming in][4] to make this app even better!
