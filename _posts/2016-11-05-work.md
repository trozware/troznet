**Work** is a project organizer app for developers, designers, students or any professional who works with multiple projects involving files & folders, web pages, email addresses and lists of to-do's. 

**Work** requires macOS 10.12 or OS X 10.11 and will be available from the Mac App Store soon, and I am looking for [beta testers][4].

We all know what it is like to be in the middle of a project or rushing to complete an assignment...

We have files scattered all over the place, email addresses of team members or clients, web pages with specifications or useful information, to-do's written on sticky notes or scraps of paper.

Wouldn't it be better if there was one place where you could have quick and easy access to all these items, but without having to change the way you work? With the **Work** app, you can regain control - the app helps you get to what you want so you save time.

Here is my project document for the **Work** app itself.

![Work][1]

I have gathered together links to the project files I need to open, images, web pages for the app and for relevant information etc. My most frequently used links are starred so I can focus on them whenever I want a shorter list.

Switching to **To-Do** mode, you can see that I have grouped my various to-do's into logical sections - and at the moment, there are no un-fixed bugs on my to-do list - hurray!

**Work** doesn't move or rename any of your files - it merely links all these things together for fast, convenient and searchable access. It even tracks files or folders if you move them later.

Make a **Work** document for every project, drag in the relevant files or folders, add web page addresses and email addresses, make your own to-do lists.

Create groups to gather items together, adjust the display to view only the entries you want, use quick look to get a fast glimpse of files or web pages.

Work also supports the Touch Bar on the new MacBook Pros:

Select **Work Help** from the **Help** menu to see a special **Work** document with useful links as well as a sequence of to-do's to guide you through the basics of using the app.
