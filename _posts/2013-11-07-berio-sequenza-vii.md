So my latest app is way outside my usual sphere but that&#8217;s what happens when family decide that what you do might actually be useful!

My son is an oboist and he is currently learning Berio&#8217;s Sequenza VII for Oboe. This is a weird piece without a standard time signature. Instead each line has 13 bars with each bar being allocated a certain time span in actual seconds. As can easily be imagined, this makes learning and practicing this piece more of a mathematical exercise than a musical one.

So I wrote him an app to sound out the end of each bar. Once he and his teacher used it, a few more features crept in and now I think it will be of great assistance to any student or teacher trying to work on this piece.

While I doubt that many oboists frequent this web site, it anyone who does can pass this on to any oboist, I would be very grateful, and I think the oboist would be too!

The app is available through the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sequenza-vii/id730234638?mt=8&#038;uo=4" target="_blank">iTunes App Store</a>.  
More details are on [this page][1].
