[Time In Words screen saver][1] has just been updated to version 1.1 and is now fully compatible with Mountain Lion. It is free to use and can be [downloaded][2] here.

The basic screen saver worked before, but searching for an alternative time zone would crash System Preferences. That is now fixed.

The screen saver also shows a thumbnail image when in Mountain Lion and is code-signed with my developer ID for compatibility with Mountain Lion&#8217;s Gatekeeper.

The current version is compatible with 10.8 and 10.7. It may work in 10.6 but I cannot be sure. If anyone tries it, please let me know.
