The first thing to do is to download the latest version of Apple's [Swift Programming Language book][1] from the iBooks Store.

You can just read this book, especially the first section: "A Swift Tour", but you will get more out of it if you follow along with the playground. There is a link to download the playground from the book which you can use directly if you are reading using iBooks on the Mac. If you are not, here is the [download link][2].

You will also need to install [Xcode][3] from the Mac App Store. Xcode is Apple's IDE and is used for programming Mac, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Apple TVs.

Swift introduced the playground to Xcode. A playground is a fantastic way to learn and experiment. You do not need to create a project, build, run a separate app, install on a device. Code typed into a playground is run immediately and you can see the results instantly, line by line.

Here is an example of a playground showing the code on the left and the result of each line appearing on the right.

Once you have gone through the Swift Tour, Apple's book becomes more of a reference guide to return to whenever you get stuck. The other way I use it is to check up on changes made when a new version of Swift is released. As the language is still rapidly evolving, these can be quite extensive. Once I have the latest version of the book, I go to the Revision History at the back and click the links to read about the features that have been added or changed.

Apart from Apple's documentation, there are a lot of great web sites, blogs and Twitter accounts out there. There are also useful newsletters that give a weekly summary of exciting developments.

Here are some of my favourites:

* [Natasha the Robot][6] - my favourite Swift blogger - sign up for her newsletter and follow her on Twitter.
* [Apple's Swift Blog][7] - not many posts, but good for learning about new features.
* [Erica Sadun][8] - sometimes a bit too technical for me, but often contains some really useful snippets. Erica has the distinction of being the first person outside Apple to have had a Swift language proposal accepted as part of the open source development process.
* [Andy Bargh][12] - detailed articles on various aspects of Swift, plus a weekly newsletter.
* [Ray Wenderlich tutorials][5] - search for Swift and find heaps of tutorials covering many different aspects.
* [Swift Sandbox][9] - weekly newsletter filled with interesting articles.
* [SwiftMonthly][10] - useful newsletter with links to tutorials, videos and projects.
* [SwiftDoc.org][11] - the documentation in Xcode is still heavily skewed towards Objective-C programmers and it can be difficult to find Swift-specific entries. This site makes it easy. 

And I hope you will keep coming back to this site to see what new Swift-related articles are available.
