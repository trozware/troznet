I am looking for beta testers for my latest Mac app: **[Work][1]**.

**Work** is a project organizer app for developers, designers, students or any professional who works with multiple projects involving files & folders, web pages, email addresses and lists of tasks. Click the link above for more information and help for getting started.

**Work** requires macOS 10.12 or OS X 10.11.

If you would like to test this app, please [contact me][2], giving details of your Mac and operating system. The easiest way to do this is to select **About This Mac** in the Apple menu and send me a screen shot of the window that appears.

All beta testers will receive a free license to Work when it is released.
If you report a legitimate bug or provide valuable feed-back, you will also receive a free license to your choice of one of my [other apps][3].
