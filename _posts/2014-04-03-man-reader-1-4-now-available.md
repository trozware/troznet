[Man Reader 1.4][1] is now available through the [Mac App Store][2].

##### The new features and fixes are:

  * Fix for plain text view not wrapping correctly for odd-sized fonts.
  * Fix for HTML text view over-riding font colors that may be invisible.
  * Search for missing entry (e.g. g++) no longer requires Enter or Return.
  * Better automatic selection of matching entries while searching.
  * Fix for animation warning message appearing in Console.
  * Status display shows when man page list is being updated.
  * Searching inside a page now allows a minimum of 2 characters (was 3), so flags  
    e.g. ‘-b’ do not need to be escaped.
  * Fixed path for Network Utility in tool bar (moved in OS X 10.9).
  * More information available about the effects of sand-boxing for this app.

For the first time, Man Reader is now also available as a [direct purchase][3].  
You can also download a [7 day free trial][4].

The reason for selling Man Reader outside the App Store is to avoid Apple&#8217;s sandboxing restrictions, which may reduce the number of man pages that Man Reader is able to display. For more information about this problem, read [Sand-boxing Man Reader][5].

If you have already purchased Man Reader from the App Store, but would like to have a non-sandboxed version, go to [Man Reader (no SB)][6] for more information on how to download a non-sandboxed version that will use your App Store licence.
