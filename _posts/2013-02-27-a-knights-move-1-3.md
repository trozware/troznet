**UPDATE:** September 2016 - A Knight's Move for iOS is no longer available.<br>
[A Knight's Move for Mac][1] is still supported.

---

A Knight&#8217;s Move has been updated to version 1.3. The Mac version is available through the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/a-knights-move/id533321133?mt=12" target="_blank">Mac App Store</a>.

## Three new level packs:

  * Eight by Eight
  * Bishops Rule
  * Castles

Eight by Eight has every puzzle set in a chessboard sized grid with more conventional placing of pieces.  
Bishops Rule has at least one Bishop in every puzzle.  
Castles has a Castle or Rook in every puzzle and is suited to players who would like more of a challenge.

## New feature:

When your knight has been taken, you have the option to undo the last move so you can try again without losing the moves you have already made.
