Following the launch of Pic-a-POD for Mac and iOS in the relevant App Stores, I decided that it was time for a new look web site. <a href="http://www.picapod.com/" target="_blank">Pic-a-POD</a> has it&#8217;s own dedicated web site, so it seemed logical to make a more product oriented site, using the same look & feel.

I have maintained some parts of the old site &#8211; LiveCode and On-Rev samples can be found in the Resources section, as can legacy version of Pic-a-POD.

I will also be able to provide information about products under development.
