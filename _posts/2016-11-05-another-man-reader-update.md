A quick update to [Man Reader][1] to version 1.8 is now available through the [Mac App Store][2].

The main reason for this version was that Man Reader was not previously detecting man pages installed by third-party IDEs in the Applications folder. There was also an issue with Man Reader failing to display the text of the previously selected man page on app launch.

* More complete search for man pages, including in third-party IDEs.
* Fix for glitch when displaying previously selected page on launch.
