&#8220;A Knight&#8217;s Move&#8221; is a fun, addictive and simple new puzzle game based on the movements of chess pieces. Your goal is to move your white knight across a board to a target square using the same movements as a knight in chess. Pawns may block your way, while enemy bishops, castles, knights and the queen may try to stop you.

The game is available for iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch from the iTunes Store and requires iOS 5.0 or later. The Mac version is available from the Mac App Store and requires OS X 10.7 or later.

Perfect for when you have a few minutes to relax, like on the train to work, during your lunch break or during a boring lecture or class (Kids: don&#8217;t take advice from randoms, but you can turn the sound FX off. Just sayin&#8217;), &#8220;A Knight&#8217;s Move&#8221; will keep you coming back for &#8220;Just One More Go&#8221;!

Once you have played the tutorial pack, you can move on to the other puzzle packs. Each pack comes with 25 more puzzles and there are many different packs allowing you to select easy puzzles, challenging puzzles or variety packs, some with themes.
