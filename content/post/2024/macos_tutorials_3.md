Click the image for more details, and if youâ€™d like to check out the start of the book including the table of contents and the first chapter, you can read it online at [macOS by Tutorials Sample][4].

The major changes in this edition include:

* Updated projects to include new features introduced in macOS 15 Sequoia and Xcode 16.
* More granular chapter organization. The table of contents is now more of an index so you can find the sections you need, with each chapter being more focussed on a single topic.
* All projects use Xcode's folder structure.
* Tabs use the new syntax.
* Previews use the new `@Previewable` macro.
* Tracking the active window uses the `@Entry` macro.
* The app in section 4 demonstrates the new windowing options.

If you already own the book and have enjoyed it or found it useful, I'd really appreciate it if you could leave a rating or review at the book's page in your Gumroad library.
