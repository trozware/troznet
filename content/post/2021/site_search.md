Not much action on the site lately as I work on other projects. But I have finally got around to adding a search option to the site.

<!--more-->

I use [Hugo][1] as a static site generator, which is great but Hugo doesn't come with any search facility.

Today, I read an article by Jesse Squires on [Replacing Google Search with DuckDuckGo][2] and while I had already switched to using [DuckDuckGo][3] for my own web searching, I had not considered it for my site search.

It isn't as good as an in-built search page, which I have considered setting up using [Algolia][4], but that requires a lot of setup and I never got round to it. This search takes you out of my site and into a DuckDuckGo page, but it limits the search options to the troz.net domain.

To access the search, go to either the [Archives][5] or the [Tags][6] page, and use the search field at the top of the page.

As a side note, if you are using DuckDuckGo as your regular search engine, read up about their [!bangs][7]. These are quick and easy ways to target your search. you can prefix your search with `!so` to search Stack Overflow, or `!i` to search for images. Search the [!bangs][7] page to find the ones that are useful to you.
