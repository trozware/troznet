I have just released [Crossfix][1] and [Crossfix Lite][2] for iPhone. They are both the same anagram assistant solver for crosswords, particularly cryptic crosswords. The Lite version is free but limits you to three solves per day. The full version is unlimited with no ads, no recurring subscriptions and works with family sharing.

For more details, check out the app page at [https://troz/net/crossfix/][3].

And if you are interested in the back story and the development process, have a look at [Name This App][4]. Thanks to everyone who suggested a name, and special thanks to Jerry who came up with the winning entry.

This is the first app that I have published that is 100% SwiftUI, although as I started it several months ago, it still uses the old App Delegate life cycle.
