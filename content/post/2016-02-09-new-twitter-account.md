title: New Twitter account
---

I have started a new Twitter account so that I can provide rapid support to
users of my apps. Please contact me [@trozware][1] if you have any questions,
suggestions, bug reports or would just like to chat.

I will also be using this account to promote my new [Learning Swift][2] series.
