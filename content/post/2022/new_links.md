As we round out the year, there are several new addresses I'd like people to use to contact me or get my book.

<!--more-->

First, raywenderlich.com has re-branded to [Kodeco][1]. Still the same great content created by terrific people, but with a fresh new design that makes it easier to follow the learning path that you prefer.

If you want to read my macOS by Tutorials book, it's now at [kodeco.com/books/macos-by-tutorials][2].

As we all know, Twitter is in meltdown and I no longer use it. I'd love it if you came over to Mastodon. People on Mastodon are friendly and sharing. It feels much more like a community.

[Movetodon][3] is a great tool for finding your Twitter friends on Mastodon and [Fedi.tips][4] is a useful site for learning how to use Mastodon effectively.

My suggestions are:

- Be nice!
- Don't stress about choosing a server, you can follow anyone from any server and you can transfer your account to a different server if you change your mind.
- Follow hashtags as well as people, and add hashtags to your posts.
- Use **Favorite** to tell people you liked their post and **Boost** to share with your followers.
- Add hashtags using UpperCamelCase to assist screen readers e.g. #AdventOfCode, not #adventofcode.
- Follow me: [@troz@mastodon.social][5]

I look forward to seeing you there.

I've added a [Mastodon][5] link to my web footer, but I also created a [LinkTree][6] to gather all my links into one place.

And finally, if you want to support my work, please [buy me a coffee][7].
