Apple has announced that their 2022 World Wide Developers Conference will again be an online event from June 7 to 11. The poster shows a very dark Swift logo in a coloured circle. While I have long since given up trying the read the tea leaves of Apple's graphics to work out what they will announce, I always enjoy speculating. But this year, I thought that instead of trying to guess what Apple will have for us, I'd think about what I would like them to announce, with my main focus being the Mac.

### Hardware

The Apple hardware teams have been doing amazing obs over the last couple of years. The transistion of the Mac lineup to Apple Silicon is almost complete and I would guess that they will complete it at WWDC with a new Mac Pro, but that is outside my budget and requirements.

While I was glad to see them offer a more reasonably priced monitor with the Studio Display, it's still a bit pricey for me. The desk lamp iMac was one of my favourite designs so it was great to see the option for the tilt & height adjustable stand, although the extra proce fvor that option was rather eye-popping.

I have long thought that the desktop iMac was terrific value becuase it attaches a stunningly good monitor to a reasonable computer. I wish Apple would supply an iMac monitor using the exact same design, but without the computer. Imagine how great that would look as a second monitor - two coloured machines side by side.

But really, I'm not looking for any new hardware right now.

### Services

iCloud needs a lot of love, especially on the Mac side. I was trying to collaborate with a colleague so they shared a folder on iCloud. I was able to access their small files after about 30 minutes, but my edits never uploaded. In the Finder sidebar, I have a perpetual progress indicator beside my iCloud folder and uploads never complete. The only solution is to reboot my computer, which does a complete sync once. We switched to sharing on our iPads and it all worked immediately, so the problem is not iCloud itself, but the macOS integration.

CloudKit has always looked like a great solution for use in apps. It allows public and private data, it syncs between devices, and it doesn't have the potential for unexpected and huge data fees like some other options. But like many developers, I've tried and failed to get it to work reliably. It appears that the simpler mechanisms work well, but not the more complex options.

And while I'm talking about iCloud sync issues, some apps (Notes, Reminders etc) sync albeit very slowly, but Messages operates as if it is only partially connected. If I delete a conversation on my iPhone or iPad, I get a warning telling me that this will remove the conversation from my other devices, which is what I would expect. This deletion flows through to my Mac and the conversation is gone everywhere. On my Mac, deleting a conversation only deletes it locally and I have to delete it again on my iPhone or iPad to get it to disppear completely. What is the logic of that?

### Software

There are two parts to the software: the operating systems and Apple's own apps. iOS, iPadOS and watchOS seems quite solid in theor latest versions. I don't have any particular requests or complaints. With macOS, apart from the iCloud problems that I mentioned above, my main complaint is with notifications. The interface is not very usable. Notifications popup at the top corner, and then disappear quickly. If they have action buttons, you have to mouse over the notification to see them, and this obscures the text. I have tried using System Preferences to change the way notifications are displayed, but this seems to have no effect.

Apart from that, I like macOS 12 (Monterey). I would prefer Apple to go back to using numbers instead of names. Trying to work out what system people are using by the name is very confusing.

The other aspect of software is Apple's in-house apps. Sadly, Apple has decided to use Catalyst to port a lot of apps from the iPad to macOS. For a small software house with very limited respurces, I can see the attraction of Catalyst although, in my opinion, it results in a greatly inferior product that gives Mac users an inferior experience. However this is hardly a valid excuse for a company the size of Apple.

### Developer Relations

This is were things get nasty. We all know that Tim Cook will bounce on to the WWDC stage saying how much they love their developers and how many billions they've paid out, but this is really just a smoke screen. Most of the money goes to a few large software houses who basically blackmail users into paying over and over again to make their apps (mostly games) usable. The race to the bottom has resulted in an app store where charging up front for an app is virtually impossible, although the Mac App Store is slightly better in this regard.

The other big issue is Apple's extremely erratic policing of the app stores. They allow behaviour in some apps and ban it is others. Big players get different treatment to small. Despite claiming that the app stores are the safe place to buy apps, they make almost no effort to weed out scam apps, copyright infringements or fake reviews.

I don't mind paying Apple a cut of my app revenue. They do a lot of work that I would find tedious or difficult to set up for myself. I don't even mind their restrictions. What I mind very deeply is the inconsistent way this is handled.
