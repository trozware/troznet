#### The new features and fixes are:

* Fix for plain text view not wrapping correctly for odd-sized fonts.
* Fix for HTML text view over-riding font colors that may be invisible.
* Search for missing entry (e.g. g++) no longer requires Enter or Return.
* Better automatic selection of matching entries while searching.
* Fix for animation warning message appearing in Console.
* Status display shows when man page list is being updated.
* Searching inside a page now allows a minimum of 2 characters (was 3), so
  flags\
  e.g. ‘-b’ do not need to be escaped.
* Fixed path for Network Utility in tool bar (moved in OS X 10.9).
* More information available about the effects of sand-boxing for this app.
