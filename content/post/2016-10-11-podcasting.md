I have recently started what I hope will be a weekly podcast with my friend and
colleague, [Jerry Daniels][2]. Each podcast will be about 30 minutes in length.

We will discuss Macs, iPhones, iPads, macOS, iOS, programming and anything
tech-related that we find interesting. I hope you will find it entertaining and
informative, so please join us.

We are using [ZCast][1] which has an iPhone app that makes it super easy to get
together and record our chats. It doesn't allow any post-processing, but really
lowers the barrier to entry into the world of podcasting.

If you get the [ZCast app for iPhone][3], go to the ZCasters tab and search for
"Trozware" or "Jerry Daniels" to find all our podcasts. Or use these links to
listen in your browser.

* [Hands-on with iPhone 7](https://zcast.co/j/ewQe6x6E4d)
* [Hands on iOS 10](https://zcast.co/j/A9zvLAAEa3)

Since the first one was recorded using my name instead of my [@trozware][4]
Twitter account, I will embed it here as it will not show up if you search for
"Trozware".
