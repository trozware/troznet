<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/time-in-words/id509085586?mt=8" target="_blank">World
Time In Words version 3.0</a> is now available in the Mac App Store.

With version 3.0 of this app, I have changed the name to "World Time In Words".
This is to reflect what I feel to be the most useful feature of this app: the
ability to convert between time zones.

It has two other new features:

1. The time shown in the menu bar can now be set to use 24-hour time. Go to
   Preferences to change this.
2. If you temporarily need to see the time in digital format, hold down Option
   when opening the menu.

And there is one other thing in this version that I am almost too embarrassed to
mention: after using this app for about two years, it was finally pointed out to
me that the 3rd of every month was being shown as the "3th". Oh dear - it was a
copy-paste error but I should I found it a long time ago.

As always, please let me know if you have any suggestions for future versions.
