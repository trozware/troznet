"What Is My Speed?" is available now from the [iTunes App Store][1] for iPhone
and Apple Watch.

![What Is My Speed? - iPhone][2]

If you read my recent blog post on [Road Trip Apps][6] you will have realised
that I was working on an app to fill a gap that I discovered in our road trip
app arsenal. So here it is: "What Is My Speed?" for iPhone.

---

Track your speed on your iPhone while driving, bicycling, running
or walking. See your course and altitude at all times.

Optionally set a speed limit and get audible warnings on your iPhone when you
exceed it. Reduce the speed limit to zero or extend it over the maximum to turn
off speed limit warnings.

Designed for easy viewing in all light conditions and with very accessible
swiping to change the speed limit quickly and easily.

If you want more detailed information, tap the info button to see a complete
list of available data about your current location. _Altitude and floor data may
not always be available but will be displayed whenever possible._

Your current iPhone settings are used to set the default units for speed and
altitude, but these are easily changed after tapping the info button.

To adjust the speed limit, swipe from side to side. The speed limit indicator
will expand for easier viewing and the speed limit will increase or decrease.
Tap again to shrink the speed limit indicator or leave it for a few seconds and
it will shrink automatically.

Tap the "?" button on the main screen to be reminded of the available swipes.

**Location permissions:** On startup, the app will request permission to access
your location. This is how the speed, course and altitude data is gathered so is
essential for the app to operate. Your location will only ever be tracked when
the app is the current foreground app.
