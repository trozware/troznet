Time In Words is a clock and calendar app that takes you out of the digital era
and back to when saying "quarter to seven" or "five past two" was accurate
enough. When people look at an analog watch, they tend to interpret the time to
the closest five minutes which allows for inaccuracies in the watch as well as
providing only a useful level of detail. This app goes back to that, showing
date and/or time in multiple ways, but all in words.

In Words is available from the App Store.</a>

Does your job involve reading out the time from a clock? Perhaps over the radio
or a public address system? Let Time In Words convert the time and date to words
for you, so you can't make a mistake.

Swipe though the pages of the app to see a time display, date display, time and
date in words and finally, a time zone converter that explains the time and the
day in words, so no conversion is needed to work out whether calling a friend in
Minsk right now would be a bad idea.

Configure the colors for the text and backgrounds and adjust the brightness to
suit your surroundings.

If you set your device's Auto-Lock to Never (Settings - General) and leave it
connected to power, then you can use this as a clock.

Screen shots are for iPhone or iPod Touch. iPad is similar but allows four time
zone conversions.
