New Release:

[19th Hole][1] &#8211; the golf scoring app for everyone.

* * *

Recent update:

  * [World Time In Words 3.0][2]

* * *

If you play the oboe seriously, then at some stage you are likely to want to learn Berio&#8217;s Sequenza VII. Its unusual timing is made easier to practice using my [Sequenza app][3] for iPhone or iPod Touch. Just updated for iOS 8.

* * *

Future plans:

  * Apple Watch: I think 19th Hole would be a perfect app for an Apple Watch companion app.
  * Icon Builder: update coming soon with support for WatchKit app icons.
