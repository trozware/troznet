When playing in a tennis match, your Apple Watch is the best way to score. Set your watch to resume last activity when raised and at the end of every point, a single tap is all it takes to record whether you won or lost the point. The watch will tell you the score for the current game as well as the score for the previous games and sets.

Any significant information is displayed: game won or lost, set won or last, match complete, change of ends, tie-breakers.

If scoring for a match that does not include you, the phone makes a good scoring device although the watch still works just as well. As with the watch, after every point it just takes a single tap to record the result of the point. The scores are displayed and significant information is announced.

The phone app records all matches played so any match can be reviewed later with the result of every game and set displayed. On the phone, the names of the players can be entered, either manually or by choosing from your contacts.  The result can be shared via email or message.
