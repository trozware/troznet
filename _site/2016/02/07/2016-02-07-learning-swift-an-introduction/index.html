<h2 id="welcome-to-learning-swift">Welcome to Learning Swift.</h2>

<p>This is the first post in what I hope will be an extensive series dealing with the Swift language. Here are some of the questions I hope to answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Should I learn Swift? Why?</li>
  <li>Why is Swift do great?</li>
  <li>How should I start learning Swift?</li>
  <li>I already know Objective-C - how do I convert?</li>
</ul>

<p>After that, I am planning a series of posts discussing the major differences of Swift from the view point of an Objective-C programmer. Topics covered will include such things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>optionals</li>
  <li>closures</li>
  <li>functional programming</li>
  <li>protocols</li>
</ul>

<p>I am coming from a background of Objective-C, so many of my posts will be dealing with aspects of Swift that are not familiar to Objective-C programmers. I will not assume any Objective-C programming experience, but some features of Swift that are new to me, will be familiar to people accustomed to other languages.</p>
