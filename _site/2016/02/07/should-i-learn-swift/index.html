<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - If you are writing or planning apps for any Apple platform - YES. If not, later.</p>

<p><strong>Long version</strong>: It depends what you are doing or plan to do…</p>

<p>Yes. This is the new language and Apple is very committed to it. Objective-C is not going away any time soon, but Swift is where it is going to end up, so why not make the jump now while the language is still in development. You have to accept that fact that every release of Xcode is going to break your code, but the automatic re-factoring works very well. And by moving to Swift now, you get the chance to influence the direction of a new language. How often does that happen?</p>

<p>If you have no history with Objective-C, then do not waste your time learning it. There is still a lot of sample code out there in Objective-C, but increasing numbers of tutorial sites are using Swift and converting their existing tutorials to Swift. It will help if you know just enough Objective-C to read it, but you do not need to know enough to write it.</p>

<p>Swift went open source in late 2015. This is a big deal and Apple’s plans for Swift are quite clear. They want Swift to be such a main-stream language that it is used instead of Java for basic computer science courses in universities. This was never going to happen unless the language was open-source and cross-platform. It is now open-source and available for <a href="https://swift.org/download/#latest-development-snapshots">Linux as well as Mac/iOS</a>. While Apple has not yet released any further ports, I think there are more on the way for Raspberry Pi, Arduino and other embedded systems as well as server-side Swift libraries like <a href="http://perfect.org">Perfect</a>. I expect that a version for Windows will not be far behind.</p>
