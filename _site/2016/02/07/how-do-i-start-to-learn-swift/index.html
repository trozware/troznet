<h2 id="how-do-i-start-to-learn-swift">How do I start to learn Swift?</h2>

<p>The first think to do is to download the latest version of Apple’s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329">Swift Programming Language book</a> from the iBooks Store.</p>

<p>You can just read this book, especially the first section: “A Swift Tour”, but you will get more out of it if you follow along with the playground. There is a link to download the playground from the book which you can use directly if you are reading using iBooks on the Mac. If you are not, here is the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=swift-tour">download link</a>.</p>

<p>You will also need to install <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835">Xcode</a> from the Mac App Store. Xcode is Apple’s IDE and is used for programming Mac, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Apple TVs.</p>

<p>Swift introduced the playground to Xcode. A playground is a fantastic way to learn and experiment. You do not need to create a project, build, run a separate app, install on a device. Code typed into a playground is run immediately and you can see the results instantly, line by line.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a playground showing the code on the left and the result of each line appearing on the right.</p>

<p>Once you have gone through the Swift Tour, Apple’s book becomes more of a reference guide to return to whenever you get stuck. The other way I use it is to check up on changes made when a new version of Swift is released. As the language is still rapidly evolving, these can be quite extensive. Once I have the latest version of the book, I go to the Revision History at the back and read about the features that have been added or changed.</p>

<p>Apart from Apple’s documentation, there are a lot of great web sites, blogs and Twitter accounts out there. There are also useful newsletters that give a weekly summary of exciting developments.</p>

<p>Here are some of my favourites:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com">Ray Wenderlich tutorials</a> - search for Swift and find heaps of tutorials covering many difference aspects.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.natashatherobot.com">Natasha the Robot</a> - my favourite Swift blogger - sign up for her newsletter and follow her on Twitter.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/">Apple’s Swift Blog</a> - not many posts, but good for learning about new features.</li>
  <li><a href="http://ericasadun.com">Erica Sadun</a> - sometimes a bit too technical for me, but often contains some really useful snippets. Erica has the distinction of being the first person outside Apple to have had a Swift language proposal accepted as part of the open source development process.</li>
  <li><a href="http://swiftsandbox.io">Swift Sandbox</a> - weekly newsletter filled with interesting articles.</li>
  <li><a href="http://swiftsandbox.io">SwiftMonthly</a> - useful newsletter with links to tutorials, videos and projects.</li>
  <li><a href="http://swiftdoc.org">SwiftDoc.org</a> - the documentation in Xcode is still heavily skewed towards Objective-C programmers and it can be difficult to find Swift-specific entries. This site makes it easy.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I hope you will keep coming back to this site to see what new Swift-related articles are available.</p>
