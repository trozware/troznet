        <title>Why is Swift so great?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I can give you the technical answer, as published by Apple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Swift is a new programming language for iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS apps that builds on the best of C and Objective-C, without the constraints of C compatibility. Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun. Swift’s clean slate, backed by the mature and much-loved Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, is an opportunity to reimagine how software development works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Swift has been years in the making. Apple laid the foundation for Swift by advancing our existing compiler, debugger, and framework infrastructure. We simplified memory management with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Our framework stack, built on the solid base of Foundation and Cocoa, has been modernized and standardized throughout. Objective-C itself has evolved to support blocks, collection literals, and modules, enabling framework adoption of modern language technologies without disruption. Thanks to this groundwork, we can now introduce a new language for the future of Apple software development.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excerpt From: Apple Inc. “&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329&quot;&gt;The Swift Programming Language (Swift 2.1)&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;now-i-can-give-you-my-opinion&quot;&gt;Now I can give you my opinion:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swift makes for code that is easier &amp;amp; faster to write.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swift makes for code that is easier &amp;amp; cleaner to read (much more important than ease of writing).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swift code is safer code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swift breaks free from the out-dated conventions of C-based languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Apple announced Swift at WWDC 2105, I was astounded. That such a major event could have been kept completely secret was amazing. Then I watched every video from WWDC 2015 that discussed Swift. Some were beyond me and others I absorbed. Looking back, I can see that the development of Objective-C over the past few years was all aimed at getting to this point, especially with the introduction of ARC and blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, I was deeply involved in an existing Objective-C project and not able to  do much in Swift. But I went through the introduction at the start of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329&quot;&gt;Swift Programming Language&lt;/a&gt; book in iBooks and was able to get some ideas about how the language worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some months later, I was able to spend time on Swift. As a learning exercise, I converted an existing Objective-C iOS app to Swift. As might be expected, I really just wrote Objective-C code using Swift syntax. It took a lot more learning before I was able to write Swift-y code instead of just translated Objective-C. In future posts of this series, I hope to enable others to cross that divide faster than I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when I go back to an Objective-C app, I feel like I am walking a tight-rope. When I use an NSArray, NSSet or NSDictionary, I think “How can I tell what sort of objects are in that array?”. When I use an object, I think “What if that object is nil?”. All of a sudden, code that appeared stable now feels random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big things that people have latched onto with Swift is that it allows functional programming. I plan several detailed posts on functional programming in this series. But for now I would just recommend that you not worry about the distinction between procedural &amp;amp; functional programming. Both have their advocates and their detractors. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Just do what ever works for you and we can worry about this later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Learning Swift - An Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;welcome-to-learning-swift&quot;&gt;Welcome to Learning Swift.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first post in what I hope will be an extensive series dealing with the Swift language. Here are some of the questions I hope to answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should I learn Swift? Why?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why is Swift so great?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How should I start learning Swift?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I already know Objective-C - how do I convert?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I am planning a series of posts discussing the major differences of Swift from the view point of an Objective-C programmer and the aspects of Swift that I found difficult to grasp. Topics covered will include such things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;optionals&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;closures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;functional programming&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;protocols&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;generics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am coming from a background of Objective-C, so many of my posts will be dealing with aspects of Swift that are not familiar to Objective-C programmers. I will not assume any Objective-C programming experience, but some features of Swift that are new to me, will be familiar to people accustomed to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s start by answering the first question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;should-i-learn-swift&quot;&gt;Should I learn Swift?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are writing or planning apps for any Apple platform - YES.&lt;br /&gt;
If not, wait until Swift is available for the platforms you need to support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-are-already-an-ios-or-mac-developer-yes&quot;&gt;If you are already an iOS or Mac developer: YES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the new language and Apple is very committed to it. Objective-C is not going away any time soon, but Swift is where it is going to end up, so why not make the jump now while the language is still in development? You have to accept that fact that every release of Xcode is going to break your code, but the automatic re-factoring works very well. And by moving to Swift now, you get the chance to influence the direction of a new language. How often does that happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-are-starting-to-learn-ios-or-mac-development-yes&quot;&gt;If you are starting to learn iOS or Mac development: YES&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have no history with Objective-C, then do not waste your time learning it. There is still a lot of sample code out there in Objective-C, but increasing numbers of tutorial sites are using Swift and converting their existing tutorials to Swift. It will help if you know just enough Objective-C to read it, but you do not need to know enough to write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-do-not-program-for-mac-or-ios-not-yet&quot;&gt;If you do NOT program for Mac or iOS: NOT YET&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swift went open source in late 2015. This is a big deal and Apple’s plans for Swift are quite clear. They want Swift to be such a main-stream language that it is used instead of Java for basic computer science courses in universities. This was never going to happen unless the language was open-source and cross-platform. It is now open-source and available for &lt;a href=&quot;https://swift.org/download/#latest-development-snapshots&quot;&gt;Linux as well as Mac/iOS&lt;/a&gt;. While Apple has not yet released any further ports, I think there are more on the way for Raspberry Pi, Arduino and other embedded systems as well as server-side Swift libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;http://perfect.org&quot;&gt;Perfect&lt;/a&gt;. I expect that a version for Windows will not be far behind.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Possible issues with Icon Builder &amp; Watch icons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It has come to my attention that there are two possible issues with Icon Builder 3.0.1 when using icons created for an Apple Watch app.
Once of them is something I can fix and the other appears to be a bug in Xcode 7.2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Version 3.2 of Icon Builder is now available in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/app/icon-builder/id552293482&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;. This removes the alpha channel from icons for a watch app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem is that iTines Connect now requires that the icons for an Apple Watch app include no alpha channel. This is becoming an increasing trend with it first having applied to the large icon file you upload directly to iTunes Connect, then to screen shots. I expect it to extend to iOS app icons soon, but hopefully Mac app icons can continue to include transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Apple Watch icons, you are supposed to create a set of square icons and watchOS or iTunesConnect applies the rounding mask. Presumably this is more complicated if the icon contains an alpha channel even if there are no transparent pixels. If your Watch app icons contain an alpha channel, you will see errors like this after uploading your app to iTunes Connect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Invalid Icon - The watch application ‘AppName.app/Watch/AppName WatchKit App.app’ contains an icon file ‘AppName.app/Watch/AppName WatchKit App.app/AppIcon-Watch24x24@2x.png’ with an alpha channel. Icons should not have an alpha channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will probably get this error message for every icon size in the Watch app (8 in total).
Until I release a new version of Icon Builder that allows for this this, I suggest you use this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cocoacontrols.com/controls/alpha-channel-remover&quot;&gt;Alpha Channel Remover app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your Xcode project, go to WatchKit App Assets.xcassets, select the AppIcon set, right-click and choose “Show in Finder”. A folder will open containing eight .png files and one .json file. Drag &amp;amp; drop the .png files into the Alpha Channel Remover window and click the “Remove Alpha Channel” button. This will replace all those image files with new versions without alpha channels. To confirm this, select any of the images and press Command-I to get info. In the More Info section, you will see “Alpha channel: No”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now submit your app again, but that only solves one of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem is that you will get a warning about the 44x44@2x.png icon file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Invalid Icon Name - The watch application ‘AppName.app/Watch/AppName WatchKit App.app’ contains an invalid icon file name ‘AppName.app/Watch/AppName WatchKit App.app/AppIcon-Watch44x44@2x.png’. Make sure that icon file names follow the pattern&lt;br /&gt; “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;*&amp;lt;dimension&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;scale&amp;gt;x.png&lt;/code&gt;” and they match the required dimensions. Please visit https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/ for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the error message, the icon name (which is set by Xcode) does conform to the required pattern, and the image is the correct size. This appears to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openradar.me/23801324&quot;&gt;bug in Xcode 7.2&lt;/a&gt; but does not stop you from submitting your app as it is only a warning and not an error. Presumably this will be fixed in later version of Xcode. I am running Xcode 7.2.1 and still see this warning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quick Score - Tennis</title>
        <description>&lt;!-- Quick Score: Tennis is available from the [iTunes App Store][1] for iPhone and Apple Watch. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick Score: Tennis will be available soon from the iTunes App Store for iPhone and Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick Score: Tennis is an app designed to allow you to score tennis matches quickly and easily on your iPhone or your Apple Watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/QST_Watch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Quick Score: Tennis on Apple Watch&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Quick Score: Tennis on Apple Watch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When playing in a tennis match, your Apple Watch is the best way to score. Set your watch to resume last activity when raised and at the end of every point, a single tap is all it takes to record whether you won or lost the point. The watch will tell you the score for the current game as well as the score for the previous games and sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/QST1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Quick Score: Tennis on iPhone&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Quick Score: Tennis on iPhone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any significant information is displayed: game won or lost, set won or last, match complete, change of ends, tie-breakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If scoring for a match that does not include you, the phone makes a good scoring device although the watch still works just as well. As with the watch, after every point it just takes a single tap to record the result of the point. The scores are displayed and significant information is announced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phone app records all matches played so any match can be reviewed later with the result of every game and set displayed. On the phone, the names of the players can be entered, either manually or by choosing from your contacts.  The result can be shared via email or message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/QST2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Quick Score: Tennis summary&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Quick Score: Tennis summary on iPhone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No ads, no in-app purchases, no features missing - you get the complete app for less than the price of a can of tennis balls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--If you like this app, please leave a rating or a review at the App Store. If you have a problem or want to suggest a new feature, please [contact me directly][2] so I can respond.--&gt;

        <title>Man Reader 1.5</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Man Reader has been updated to version 1.5 with a major improvement in the way it looks for available man pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/manreader/&quot;&gt;Man Reader 1.5&lt;/a&gt; is now available through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/app/man-reader/id522583774?mt=12&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;change-log&quot;&gt;Change Log:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Much improved searching for available man pages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sand-boxed version now works just as well as the non-sand-boxed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main feature of this version is that it solves the previous problems with the App Store version and sand-boxing. This was restricting the number of man pages listed in Man Reader so I had to release a non-sand-boxed version of the app to allow for full functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I discovered that although this gave better results, it was still missing a lot of man pages. Version 1.5 now queries the man page files in a completely different way which is listing many more man pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you previously had downloaded the Man Reader (no SB) version of the app from this site, please revert to the App Store version which you would have needed to have bought in order to use the downloaded app. If you bought the app from Paddle, &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#115;&amp;#097;&amp;#114;&amp;#097;&amp;#104;&amp;#064;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#122;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#063;&amp;#115;&amp;#117;&amp;#098;&amp;#106;&amp;#101;&amp;#099;&amp;#116;&amp;#061;&amp;#077;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#037;&amp;#050;&amp;#048;&amp;#082;&amp;#101;&amp;#097;&amp;#100;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#037;&amp;#050;&amp;#048;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#102;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#037;&amp;#050;&amp;#048;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#037;&amp;#050;&amp;#048;&amp;#065;&amp;#112;&amp;#112;&amp;#037;&amp;#050;&amp;#048;&amp;#083;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; and I will transfer you to the App Store version. Neither of these other versions will be supported or updated any more.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Using 19th Hole on the Apple Watch</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;19th Hole for iPhone and Apple Watch version 3 is now available through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-19th-hole/id871686159?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&quot;&gt;iTunes App Store&lt;/a&gt;.
This version is a complete re-write to accommodate the changes in iOS 9 and watchOS2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major changes are to do with the way the iPhone and the Watch communicate. In watchOS1, all the brains of the app had to live in the iPhone, meaning that every single interaction on the Watch had to be referred back to the iPhone for processing and the result sent back to the Watch for display. This lead to communications delays and breakdowns which caused third-party apps to work sluggishly or not at all. In watchOS2, the brains of the watch part of the app can now operate inside the watch, greatly reducing the number of communications needed. As well as that, Apple has now provided us with multiple ways of getting data to and from the Watch which again improves performance and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 19th Hole, I made the decision to change the method of inputting scores. The previous version used a slider with plus and minus buttons to adjust scores. The problems with this were the small target area of the plus &amp;amp; minus buttons as well as the fact that a slider with more than about 3 divisions was not useful as a visual indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When watchOS2 allowed developers access to the digital crown, I decided to switch to using that instead. Now you tap the score box of the player you wish to adjust and use the digital crown to select a number. I think this will be easier to use while wearing a glove and hope that it is still easy to read out doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other suggestion is not to do with watchOS2 but is a general tip for using apps of this kind. By default, the Apple Watch will always show the watch face when you raise your wrist. Normally this is the most useful thing, but when scoring a round of golf, it would be easier if The 19th Hole app stayed at the front. To make this happen, you need to set to watch to show the last used app instead of the watch face. This can be set using the Apple Watch app on the phone or on the watch itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the phone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the Apple Watch app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select My Watch from the tabs at the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap “General” and then scroll down to tap “Wake Screen”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure “Resume Last Activity” is checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the watch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the digital crown to see the app icons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find and tap the Settings icon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down and tap “General”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tap “Wake Screen” and scroll down to make sure that “Previous Activity” is checked in the “Resume To” section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Dice Pass for Mac</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We live in a world of passwords and passphrases and there is a constant struggle between having a secure and a memorable password. As a result, many of us re-use passwords even though we know this is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/936/&quot;&gt;XKCD&lt;/a&gt; had a wonderful comic that illustrated the theory of using a passphrase composed of words that are easy to remember but with a combination that made the passphrase very hard to guess. However even when deciding to use a passphrase like this, it is not easy for us humans to avoid using words that have meaning for us, particularly when it is something we really need to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html&quot;&gt;Diceware&lt;/a&gt; was developed to solve this problem. You have a set of 5 dice and a list of words assigned to each possible dice roll for 11111 to 66666. You roll the five dice and get the matching word from the list. Repeat this for the number of words you want to use in your passphrase and you have a random phrase that is hopefully still memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this sounds like a lot of effort and not something you are likely to do when faced by a password entry field on a web page. So &lt;a href=&quot;/dicepass/&quot;&gt;Dice Pass&lt;/a&gt; was written to do the work for you quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/DicePass_Mac.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dice Pass for Mac&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select the number of words you want in your passphrase and see the phrase immediately. Keep clicking the “Generate New Phrase” button until you get a phrase you like. If you feel that the computer is not to be trusted when generating a random number for the dice rolls, use your real dice and click the dice to change them to the roll you got. If you get a passphrase that is good except for one or two words, use the Re-Roll button beside those words to get a new roll for just that word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dice Pass is available from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/dice-pass/id997688302?mt=12&amp;amp;uo=4&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt; now and coming soon for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dice Pass</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dice Pass is available from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dice-pass/id997688302&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt; for Mac OS X and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/dice-pass/id998397511&quot;&gt;iTunes App Store&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone or iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dice Pass is a utility to app to generate random passphrases based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html&quot;&gt;Diceware system&lt;/a&gt;. Diceware uses a table of pre-defined words, each assigned a 5 digit code number containing the digits 1 to 6. The official way to generate a phrase is to roll 5 dice for each word you want in your passphrase and then consult the words table to find the matching word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting phrase uses real words or common abbreviations, so it is easier to remember than a random collection of characters. At the same time, the random selection of words makes the generated passphrase much more secure as it avoids the human tendency to pick words with personal meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Diceware system was invented by Arnold Reinhold. This utility is not associated with or supported by Arnold Reinhold in any way, but uses his techniques with thanks. For more information about Diceware, have a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://world.std.com/%7Ereinhold/dicewarefaq.html&quot;&gt;Diceware Passphrase FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word list used in this app is a variation compiled by &lt;a href=&quot;http://world.std.com/~reinhold/beale.wordlist.asc&quot;&gt;Alan Beale&lt;/a&gt; that removes some of the more obscure words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;F.A.Q.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many words should I use in my passphrase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arnold Reinhold recommends 6 words. He used to suggest that 5 was sufficient for most needs, but as of 2014 has increased this to 6. See the Diceware Passphrase FAQ page for more details. (Link above.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often can I re-generate the passphrase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As often as you like. Keep clicking until you get a phrase that you can remember. If you get a phrase where most of the words are good but you would like to change one or two, you can click ‘Re-Roll’ on individual words to change them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a way to check the strength of my passphrase?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many password strength checkers on the internet and three of these are listed below. But always be careful when pasting your passphrase into a web page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online password strength checkers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rumkin.com/tools/password/passchk.php&quot;&gt;Rumkin.com Strength Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://howsecureismypassword.net&quot;&gt;How Secure Is My Password?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.passwordmeter.com&quot;&gt;The Password Meter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the words in the phrase are not complete words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theory is that shorter words or abbreviations are easier to remember than long ones, without compromising security. But if you get a word you don’t like or think that you will not be able to remember, just re-roll that word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I want to roll the dice myself?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dice Pass allows you to tap on the 5 dice to set the numbers needed for each word manually. Each time you tap the number will go up be one, wrapping from 6 back to 1. The app will then look up the word table for you and show the new word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the phrase gets too long I can’t see all the words.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Copy” button will copy the complete passphrase even if it is not all visible. You can also scroll by clicking and dragging along the passphrase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does my passphrase get saved by the app or transmitted over the internet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. The app saves no data except for basic preferences (window positioning &amp;amp; size etc.). There is never any data sent over the network and the app will work perfectly if you disconnect your computer before using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are those 3 buttons: #, A and 1?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sites may require a passphrase that contains a mix of character types. These buttons will insert a special character, change the start of one word to uppercase, or insert a number. Tap the button again to undo the change. Again, these characters are chosen using the dice roll system and the special characters are selected and positioned using the method and data suggested by Arnold Reinhold.&lt;/p&gt;
