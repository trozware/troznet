Related to this is the App Store review and rating system. Prospective purchasers choose between similar apps based on ratings and reviews. Many people detest being asked for a rating or review - [John Gruber of Daring Fireball][1] even suggested giving a one star rating to every app that does so for exactly that reason. But asking passively in the release notes or in an About screen on your app does nothing. The only way to get a positive review is to ask for it. (Negative reviews are another matter - people who encounter a problem with your app are much more likely to leave a review that people who love it.)

In the upcoming iOS 10.3, Apple is starting to deal with this by introducing a standard method for asking for reviews. This is limited to three requests per year and allows the user to respond inside your app without exiting to the App Store so this should be a big improvement.

What it doesn't address is the problem of reviews and ratings not carrying over to a new version. While this is great for getting rid of negative reviews that may be caused by a bug you have since fixed, it is not so good if you have a great rating and lots of positive reviews. The end result is to discourage new releases of successful apps.

How would I solve this? I would ask developers to use an M.m.p version numbering system:

* M is a major version and changing that would clear all reviews and ratings.
* m is a minor version and clearing existing ratings would be optionally decided by the developer.
* p is for point releases and would not clear anything.

This gives the developer some control while still avoiding the endless accumulation of reviews about past version which would only confuse the prospective purchaser.
