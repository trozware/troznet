**Work** is a project organizer app for developers, designers, students or any professional who works with multiple projects involving files & folders, web pages, email addresses and lists of to do items. 

**Work** requires macOS 10.12 or OS X 10.11.

We all know what it is like to be in the middle of a project or rushing to complete an assignment...

We have files scattered all over the place, email addresses of team members or clients, web pages with specifications or useful information, to dos written on sticky notes or scraps of paper.

Wouldn't it be better if there was one place where you could have quick and easy access to all these items, but without having to change the way you work? With the **Work** app, you can regain control - the app helps you get to what you want so you save time.

Here is my project document for the **Work** app itself.

![Work][1]

I have gathered together links to the project files I need to open, images, web pages for the app and for relevant information etc. My most frequently used links are starred so I can show just them whenever I want a shorter list.

Switching to **To Do** mode, you can see that I have grouped my various to do items into logical sections - and at the moment, there are no un-fixed bugs on my to do list - hurray!

**Work** doesn't move or rename any of your files - it merely links all these things together for fast, convenient and searchable access.

Make a **Work** document for every project, drag in the relevant files or folders, add web page addresses and email addresses, make your own to do lists.

Create groups to gather items together, view them the way you want to, quick look to get a fast glimpse of files or web pages.

Select **Work Help** from the **Help** menu to see a special **Work** document with useful links as well as a sequence of to dos to guide you through the basics of using the app.
