      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think I wrote the first version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://picapod.com&#34;&gt;Pic-a-POD&lt;/a&gt; in 2003 and have been updating and maintaining it ever since, but the time has come to shut it down.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving to the Dark Side - Part 2</title>

&lt;p&gt;Now that most of my Mac apps have been updated to support macOS Mojave&amp;rsquo;s dark mode, it was time to turn my attention to this web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the release of macOS Mojave on 24th September 2018, I have started updating my Mac apps, mainly to enable support for dark mode if appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I have updated this site too. Click the light bulb icon at the top right of the page to toggle between light and dark modes for this site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Swift Strings Helper</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hands up everyone who can remember how to work with Swift strings, especially when it comes to substrings and ranges? &amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me neither. So I decided that I would work it out once and create myself a library to make it easy for myself in the future. And then I thought that other people might like it too. So I have created my first open sourced project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Functional Programming in Swift</title>

      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2018/functional-programming/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is Functional Programming and how can we use it in Swift?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search online for any definition of functional programming and you will find many different definitions, few of which are practically helpful. I have no claim to be an expert, but as a Swift enthusiast, this is what I have distilled out of the morass.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>World Time in Words iOS Update</title>

      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2018/world-time-in-words-ios-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its been a long time since the last update to Time In Words for iOS but after prompting by Apple (&lt;em&gt;update or we will remove it from the App Store&lt;/em&gt;), I finally did it. I was never really happy with the last design of Time in Words for iOS, particularly for the iPad, so this was a good opportunity to do a complete re-design, bringing the app more into alignment with its Mac counterpart. And it got a new name to match its new direction and is now called World Time in Words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why is important to style your code?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you decide on a style?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to enforce this style automatically?&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I came to update my blog: I had a new post in draft form and I wanted
to update the Swift code to version 4. However installing High Sierra had
removed &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com&#34; title=&#34;Jekyll&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; which is the site generator that I had been using. I
re-installed Jekyll but found that it had been updated from version 2 to version
3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JSON Parsing in Swift 4</title>
      <link>https://troz.net/post/2017/json-parsing-in-swift-4/</link>

      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2017/json-parsing-in-swift-4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated:&lt;/strong&gt; 3rd September 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checked syntax using Xcode 9.0 beta 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added section on &lt;a href=&#34;#nulls&#34;&gt;allowing for nulls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;strong&gt;JSON&lt;/strong&gt; has become the de facto standard for data transfers around the
internet, there has always been a lot of interest in Swift libraries to parse
JSON into Swift classes or structs. Searching for &amp;ldquo;swift json library&amp;rdquo; on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/search?q=swift+json+library&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; discovers &lt;s&gt;77&lt;/s&gt; 86 repositories. So why are there so many? And
what has Swift 4 done to &lt;em&gt;sherlock&lt;/em&gt; them all?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Last week I got a 10.5â iPad Pro. I have had an iPad ever since the original release, but I have to confess to mainly using it for content consumption rather than creation. Since I am usually close to a Mac anyway, there didnât seem a lot of point. But now that iOS 11 is really addressing the issue of making the iPad a &amp;ldquo;pro&amp;rdquo; device, I decided to give it a try.</description>

alternative to RSS. TrozWare has had an XML RSS feed for years, but I don&amp;rsquo;t
think anyone ever uses it (I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t), so today I have replaced it with
a JSON feed, which you can access through the
&lt;a class=&#34;fa fa-rss&#34; href=&#34;https://troz.net/feed.json&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; button at the top of every page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I use my iPad to play games as a form of relaxation. Nearly all the games I play are puzzle apps with levels that can be played in a few minutes. Nearly all of them are free to install. So how do they make money?
Now I would be the last person you should consult about marketing but it has always seemed to me that the best way to market your product is to convince people that it offers something they want so that they are prepared to pay for it.</description>

      <description>A quick update to Man Reader to version 1.8 is now available through the Mac App Store.
The main reason for this version was that Man Reader was not previously detecting man pages installed by third-party IDEs in the Applications folder. There was also an issue with Man Reader failing to display the text of the previously selected man page on app launch.
 More complete search for man pages, including in third-party IDEs.</description>

      <description>Man Reader has just been updated to version 1.7 and is available through the Mac App Store.
The main reason for this update was to make the app work well with macOS Sierra, as I found that version 1.6 was sometimes crashing on launch. While doing this, the update was rejected by the App Store reviewers because it crashed on OS X 10.10. Since I no longer have a Mac running 10.</description>

What does Dice Pass do? Dice Pass is a utility to app to generate random passphrases based on the Diceware system.

The official way to generate a phrase is to roll 5 dice for each word you want in your passphrase and then consult the words table to find the matching word.</description>

      <description>With the release of iOS 10 and the need to update iOS apps to suit, I have decided it is time to retire some of my lesser-performing apps as it is not worth the effort required to maintain them.
At the moment, the following iOS apps are no longer available:
 A Knight&amp;rsquo;s Move Dice Pass Pic-a-POD Quick Score - Tennis  For the first three listed there, the Mac versions are still available:</description>

Change Log:  Permissions fix when searching for available man pages. Fixed error with new search term being over-written. Sand-boxed version now works just as well as the non-sand-boxed so please switch back to this version.</description>

      <description>I recently got an email from someone who had purchased Dice Pass for Mac from the Mac App Store but had been unable to get it to run. This person was using OS X 10.9.3.
I checked the App Store specifications and it showed that 10.9 was the minimum system requirement, so it should have worked. But going back to my Xcode project, I found that it was set to a minimum of OS X 10.</description>

      <description>Sets are the forgotten collection type in many languages, including Swift. I think most developers use Arrays without really considering the advantages of using a Set but they have some amazingly useful features that should make them a part of any progammer&amp;rsquo;s toolkit.

What is a Set? A Set is an un-ordered collection of unique items.</description>

      <description>One of the problems with using 19th Hole on the Apple Watch is making the app show every time you raise your wrist. My solution to this was to go into Settings (either on my iPhone through the Watch app, or directly on the watch) and change it to &amp;ldquo;Resume Last Activity&amp;rdquo; on wrist raise. This worked fine but as I usually prefer the watch face to show on wrist raise, I had to keep setting and re-setting this which was a pain.</description>

      <description>As the Apple Watch hits its first birthday, there seems to be in increasing number of bloggers complaining about it. One (which I refuse to link to) titled &amp;ldquo;My Year of Hell With the Apple Watch&amp;rdquo;. I think the article has since been re-published with a slightly less inflammatory title, but really! Did somebody rivet the watch to his wrist? If it was so awful, why not just stop using it?</description>

      <title>Structs vs Classes</title>
      <link>https://troz.net/post/2016/structs-vs-classes/</link>

      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2016/structs-vs-classes/</guid>
      <description>One of the big debates among Swift developers is when to use structs and when to use classes.
Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming but structs as provided by Swift are newly powerful. Structs have been around in C-based languages for a long time, but Swift has made them more powerful and given them more features so that they are almost indistinguishable from classes. So what are the differences and which one should you use?</description>

      <title>Learning Swift - For-Loops</title>

      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2016/learning-swift-for-loops/</guid>
      <description>Loops are a fundamental building block of any program. Doing repetitive tasks fast and accurately is what computers are really good at and what we humans get very bored doing. Swift offers several different ways to perform loops, but today we are going to concentrate on for-loops.
The most basic form of loop is the for-in loop. There are two ways this can be used: looping over the numbers in a range or looping over the elements in an array or dictionary.</description>

      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2016/learning-swift-generics/</guid>
      <description>One of the nice things about Swift is how clean your code looks. A lot of the weird characters that pepper the code of other languages has been eliminated: No more semi-colons, asterisks etc.
But then you are reading somebody else&amp;rsquo;s code and you find these angle brackets all over the place and they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to make sense.
What does this mean?
func mid&amp;lt;T: Comparable&amp;gt;(array: [T]) -&amp;gt; T  It looks like it is a function to find the middle element in an array, but what is &amp;lt;T: Comparable&amp;gt; or [T] or even just T?</description>

      <description>I was driving through the town of Singleton the other day and of course, it got me thinking about using singletons in my apps. Singletons were a commonly used pattern in Objective-C programming and appear in many of Apple&amp;rsquo;s own APIs, but seem to be increasingly frowned upon in the Swift world.
So what is a singleton? A singleton is a class that only expects to have a single instance.</description>

1. Editor color themes and fonts: Step through the supplied themes and find the best one for you. Then click the &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo; button at the bottom of the list and duplicate the selected theme. Now you can tweak it to suit you.</description>

You can just read this book, especially the first section: &amp;ldquo;A Swift Tour&amp;rdquo;, but you will get more out of it if you follow along with the playground. There is a link to download the playground from the book which you can use directly if you are reading using iBooks on the Mac.</description>

      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2016/why-is-swift-so-great/</guid>
      <description>Firstly, I can give you the technical answer, as published by Apple:
 Swift is a new programming language for iOS, OS X, watchOS, and tvOS apps that builds on the best of C and Objective-C, without the constraints of C compatibility. Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun. Swiftâs clean slate, backed by the mature and much-loved Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, is an opportunity to reimagine how software development works.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Learning Swift. This is the first post in what I hope will be an extensive series dealing with the Swift language. Here are some of the questions I hope to answer:
 Should I learn Swift? Why? Why is Swift so great? How should I start learning Swift? I already know Objective-C - how do I convert?  After that, I am planning a series of posts discussing the major differences of Swift from the view point of an Objective-C programmer and the aspects of Swift that I found difficult to grasp.</description>

      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2016/possible-issues-with-iconbuilder/</guid>
      <description>It has come to my attention that there are two possible issues with Icon Builder 3.0.1 when using icons created for an Apple Watch app. Once of them is something I can fix and the other appears to be a bug in Xcode 7.2
Update: Version 3.2 of Icon Builder is now available in the Mac App Store. This removes the alpha channel from icons for a watch app.
The first problem is that iTines Connect now requires that the icons for an Apple Watch app include no alpha channel.</description>

      <description>19th Hole for iPhone and Apple Watch version 3 is now available through the iTunes App Store. This version is a complete re-write to accommodate the changes in iOS 9 and watchOS2.
The major changes are to do with the way the iPhone and the Watch communicate. In watchOS1, all the brains of the app had to live in the iPhone, meaning that every single interaction on the Watch had to be referred back to the iPhone for processing and the result sent back to the Watch for display.</description>

      <description>Time In Words for iOS started off as a fun gimmick, emulating the Qlocktwo type of time display where the relevant words are highlighted in some way to spell out the time as a sentence. This very quickly evolved into what I hoped would be more useful app, still showing the original display, but also providing the current time &amp;amp; date as complete sentences. Then I added time conversions and discovered the real power and utility of writing out times as words.</description>

I expected that App Store review times would go up dramatically once Apple had allowed developers to submit watch apps, but this proved to be incorrect. Three days after submission, the app was marked as &amp;ldquo;In Review&amp;rdquo;. This seemed to happen last thing on a Saturday, so there was no further action for two days, at which point the app was rejected, with the following details (sic):</description>

      <description>I have just submitted my first Apple Watch app to the iTunes App Store. This is a scary thing to do, since I have never seen, touched or used an Apple Watch and all I had to go on was the Simulator that Apple supplies with Xcode.
At the moment, Apple has only made a limited set of Apple Watch features available to developers, and all Apple Watch apps come tethered to an iOS app - presumably this will mainly be iPhone apps, but I wonder will we be able to connect Apple Watches to iPads?</description>

      <description>So why an announcement for such a minor upgrade?
Version 3.0 got no announcement because it was not the release I wanted.
Having downloaded the Xcode 6.2 &amp;amp; 6.3 betas, I had worked out what icons were needed to a WatchKit app. This, combined with several other changes, made me bump the version number to 3.0.
Sadly, Apple rejected the update because it referred to pre-release products. So I pulled all mentions of WatchKit out of the interface and meta data and got 3.</description>

I have been working on an update to 19th Hole and since it uses a custom method for data input, I decided that a video would be really useful in this case.</description>

Firstly, there is the structure of the post Markdown document, which really boils down to the file name and the header.
I have set up a macro in Typinator so that I just type the title of the post in a text document. I copy that title to the clipboard and type the shortcut. The header is then created with the title and the formatted permalink.</description>

      <description>Welcome to TrozWare&amp;rsquo;s new site. It appears that I am not alone in deciding to move away from WordPress. WordPress is great - easy to set up and with lots of cool themes to allow customisation of your site. But it is slow, especially if (like me) you are running on a low-cost shared server.
I had been reading about Jekyll, so I decide to give it a go and also host my site on GitHub, taking advantage of their faster servers.</description>

      <description>Some people are moving away from email, but for me, it remains the best way to communicate online. I get to keep a record of conversations and the attached files are with the text so I can always see the context.
But I think everyone would agree that Apple have dropped the ball with Mail in OS X Mavericks, and to a lesser extent, in iOS 7.
So I have been on a campaign lately to find an email client that suits my needs.</description>

      <description>So my latest app is way outside my usual sphere but that&amp;rsquo;s what happens when family decide that what you do might actually be useful!
My son is an oboist and he is currently learning Berio&amp;rsquo;s Sequenza VII for Oboe. This is a weird piece without a standard time signature. Instead each line has 13 bars with each bar being allocated a certain time span in actual seconds. As can easily be imagined, this makes learning and practicing this piece more of a mathematical exercise than a musical one.</description>

      <description>Icon Builder 1.2 was released on 18 September 2013.
It was an update with 2 new functions:
 The ability to create images to suit an Xcode 5 assets library The ability to create icons with the required sizes for IOS 7 apps.  Knowing that iOS 7 apps can only be built using Xcode 5, I linked the switch for these 2 abilities in a single check box.
The problem was not really that they were in a single checkbox but that I had labelled it badly, so it was not obvious that this was what needed to be checked to create iOS 7 sized icon files.</description>

Markdown has been on my list of &amp;ldquo;things I should learn some day&amp;rdquo; so I was interested last week to read about a new iBooks book called The MacSparky Markdown Field Guide. This was sufficient inspiration so I got the book and read through it this weekend.</description>

However it was recently brought to my attention (thanks Cameron), that when running on a Retina MBP, all the icon files were exactly twice as large as they should be. The Icon.png file which supplies the main app icon for iPhone apps should be 57 pixels by 57 pixels.</description>

      <description>There are been a lots of stories going around about lengthening Mac App Store review times. Shiny Developments crowd-sourced data certainly backs this up although they have much more data for iOS apps than for Mac apps.
Some people, including Lex Friedman of MacWorld and John Gruber of Daring Fireball, are suggesting that the delays are due to the rush of new apps to support the iPhone 5 and iOS 6.</description>

      <description>As of June 2012, all apps submitted to the Mac App Store have to be sandboxed i.e. they have to be able to run in a limited environment where they cannot interfere with other apps or other parts of the system. While this is generally a good thing, there are problems when apps have legitimate reasons for requiring access to other resources.
One annoyance for developers is that Apple&amp;rsquo;s apps are mostly not sandboxed.</description>

      <description>The new iPad has a Retina display, meaning that the pixel density is much greater. For some apps, this is a problem as their graphics are now scaled and look pixellated. However Time In Words is very simple. It uses standard fonts and interface widgets with no images or external graphics apart from the icon. The icon may not look perfect on a new iPad, but the display itself should look really great.</description>

These buttons have been used much more than originally intended, with the new multitasking required double-presses, not to mention access to the camera etc. So basically , it is wearing out.
The phone is out of warranty and there is no way I am going to pay for an expensive repair when my current phone contract will expire later this year, and hopefully the iPhone 5 will be ready for me then.</description>

With [Time In Word for iOS][2], I used picker wheels which are excellent for selecting hierarchical data. On the Mac, there is no such thing as the iOS picker wheel and so I had to consider what to use instead.
When you ask the system (Mac or iOS) for the available time zones, you get a list of names like this:</description>

      <description>With the introduction of OS X 10.7 (Lion), Apple removed the obvious scroll bars from windows and replaced them with a much more subtle scroll indicator, that only appears when you are actually scrolling. This was designed to match the iOS scrolling, as was the swap of scroll direction which makes much more sense if you use a trackpad.
With the upcoming Time In Words for Mac, I have a Preferences window to allow selection of time zones to display in the menu.</description>

      <description>Time In Words is now available at the App Store.
Time In Words is a clock and calendar app that takes you out of the digital era and back to when saying âquarter to sevenâ or âfive past twoâ was accurate enough.

Check out the Time In Words web page for more info and screen shots.</description>
