  <div class="post-content"><p>As the Apple Watch hits its first birthday, there seems to be in increasing
number of bloggers complaining about it. One (which I refuse to link to) titled
&ldquo;My Year of Hell With the Apple Watch&rdquo;. I think the article has since been
re-published with a slightly less inflammatory title, but really! Did somebody
rivet the watch to his wrist? If it was so awful, why not just stop using it?</p>
<p>I am a watch nerd and have always loved watches and having one on me. I liked
watches with features and even had a calculator watch at one point although as a
woman with skinny wrists, I found it constantly annoying that watch makers put
all the gadgets into man-sized watches so I was left with the choice of no
features or a watch that looked stupidly large on my wrist.</p>
<p>A few years ago I stopped wearing a watch. I can&rsquo;t remember now why I did it -
maybe my watch strap broke and it wasn&rsquo;t important enough to get a new one. I
always had my iPhone to give me the time.</p>
<p>But I ordered three Apple Watches as soon as they were available and myself,
husband and eldest son have been using them ever since.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="here-are-what-i-consider-to-be-the-best-features-of-the-apple-watch">
  Here are what I consider to be the best features of the Apple Watch:
  <a href="#here-are-what-i-consider-to-be-the-best-features-of-the-apple-watch" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong>: It is a fantastically accurate time-piece. Not enough people
give this credit, but we have always been used to clocks and watches that were
inherently inaccurate. Having a device on my wrist that I <strong>know</strong> to be
perfectly accurate is an amazing thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Notifications</strong>: this takes a bit of work to get right and with every new
app, you need to assess whether to have its notifications appear on your
wrist. But the wonderful thing is knowing that you haven&rsquo;t missed anything and
being able to glance at your wrist when a notification arrives and tell -
unobtrusively - whether this is something that needs immediate attention. And
the ability to respond instantly to messages and emails with just a couple of
taps is amazingly useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customisable watch faces</strong>: depending on what I am doing, I need quick
access to different pieces of information. When travelling, I can set up a
watch face with multiple time zones. When working, I need a timer. When on
holiday, I prefer one of the more relaxing but less detailed watch faces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Activity</strong>: I am not the world&rsquo;s most active person so I find the three
rings to be a really good motivator. In fact I just had to stop typing and run
up &amp; down the stairs to get another notch to the blue ring. The goals are not
out of my reach, so I like trying to fill in the rings every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voice commands</strong>: being able to send a text message completely by voice when
driving or when my hands are busy is fantastic. Starting a timer, doing unit
conversions and navigating are things I do frequently by voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Excellent battery life</strong>: I started off having the battery life complication
always visible, but it very quickly became apparent that this was unnecessary.
Right now I have been wearing the watch for about 11 hours and the battery is
at 74%. And charging is so fast that if I did run it down, a 30 minute charge
would get me through most of a day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Milanese Loop</strong>: best watch band ever.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other good features, but I think those are my favourites.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="so-what-dont-i-like">
  So what don&rsquo;t I like?
  <a href="#so-what-dont-i-like" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Third-party apps are still a problem</strong>. I know. I have published three
myself and sometimes they just doesn&rsquo;t happen. However this appears to vary a
lot. Some people say they can never get apps to run, even Apple&rsquo;s apps. Others
say they work but with a long delay. My watch seems to be better than the
average but it is still an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sketches don&rsquo;t always get through or can take ages</strong>. We thought it would be
a lot of fun to send each other little sketches and so it is, despite our
total lack of any artistic skills. But it loses a bit of impact when you have
to send a message 20 minutes later asking if the sketch has arrived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The exercise tracking seems to be a bit erratic</strong>. If my husband and I go
for a walk together, he comes back with 25 minutes of exercise and I only have
7 minutes. Am I not going fast enough? Are my arms not swinging enough? If it
is very hot and my wrist gets sweaty, I seem to get better numbers - is this
because my heart is beating faster or the capillaries closer to the surface
have expanded? Or is the watch picking up a better signal that way? Either
way, I still like the activity circles, but the green ring frustrates me a
bit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="and-what-would-i-like-to-see-in-watch-2--watchos-3">
  And what would I like to see in Watch 2 / watchOS 3?
  <a href="#and-what-would-i-like-to-see-in-watch-2--watchos-3" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some sort of always-on display of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A speaker to allow Siri to talk back to me and to play audio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FaceTime audio calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better support for third-party apps - perhaps open up some private APIs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow developers to create watch faces or apps that told the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow developers to say that an app should stay as the frontmost app once
opened.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="will-i-buy-watch-2">
  Will I buy Watch 2?
  <a href="#will-i-buy-watch-2" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h2>
<p>At this stage I would say no. We bought the bottom-of-the-line Sport models
because with version 1.0 of anything, you don&rsquo;t want to spend so much that
upgrading is ruled out. However these watches are still going great and a lot of
the improvements I am looking for will be in software not hardware.</p>
<p>But 14 months ago, I was waiting for Apple to announce the iWatch as we all
thought it would be called, and saying that I didn&rsquo;t think I would get one. The
feature list convinced me and I have been delighted with it. So if Watch 2 comes
up with some killer feature that matters to me, then I might have to
re-consider&hellip;</p>
