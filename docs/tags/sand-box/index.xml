      <description>These instructions are no longer valid. As of version 1.5, the App Store version of Man Reader has solved the sand-boxing issues and is now as powerful as the non-sand-boxed version.
The non-sand-boxed version will no longer be supported or updated, so please revert to the App Store version.
If you find that Man Reader is not working well for you due to Apple&amp;rsquo;s sandboxing restrictions, then you can download a non-sandboxed version here.</description>

As with all apps in the App Store, Man Reader is restricted by Apple&amp;rsquo;s sand-boxing policy. Sand-boxing is a great thing. It isolates apps from each other and from the system, making it far less likely that a problem app will cause wide-spread havoc.</description>

      <title>Sandboxing and the Mac App Store</title>

      <description>As of June 2012, all apps submitted to the Mac App Store have to be sandboxed i.e. they have to be able to run in a limited environment where they cannot interfere with other apps or other parts of the system. While this is generally a good thing, there are problems when apps have legitimate reasons for requiring access to other resources.
One annoyance for developers is that Apple&amp;rsquo;s apps are mostly not sandboxed.</description>
