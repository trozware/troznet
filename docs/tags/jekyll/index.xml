<title>Moving to Hugo</title>
<link>https://troz.net/post/2017/moving-to-hugo/</link>

      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2017/moving-to-hugo/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I came to update my blog: I had a new post in draft form and I wanted
to update the Swift code to version 4. However installing High Sierra had
removed &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com&#34; title=&#34;Jekyll&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; which is the site generator that I had been using. I
re-installed Jekyll but found that it had been updated from version 2 to version
3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;jekyll-problems&#34;&gt;Jekyll Problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my problems started: missing dependencies due to the basic Jekyll install
no longer including certain features, and then syntax errors due to changes in
the way things are done, particularly to do with pagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to fix this myself, then thought that maybe the theme I was using had
already solved these issues so I tried re-installing that. It wanted to add
about 25 more gems and then failed to install - sigh - spend some time rolling
that back&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I decided that if Jekyll was going to cause me a lot of trouble,
it might be worth looking at an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main criteria were the ability to import my Jekyll site and the ability to
host on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; title=&#34;GitHub Pages&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. After checking out the options, I decided to have a
look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34; title=&#34;Hugo&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-to-hugo&#34;&gt;Moving to Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most lauded features of Hugo is speed. I had found with Jekyll that
when I saved an edited page, it took about 5 seconds before the edits could be
reloaded into the browser. Hugo is supposedly fast and does auto reloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&#34; title=&#34;Hugo Quick Start&#34;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/a&gt; guide, I installed Hugo. Importing my Jekyll site
worked easily and so fast I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure anything had happened, transferring my
posts to &lt;code&gt;contents/posts&lt;/code&gt; and my other files (status pages, images etc.) to
&lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the main exercise appeared to be choosing a theme which would provide not
only the visuals but the capabilities of the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I drew up a list of demands for any theme I chose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;must-have-features&#34;&gt;Must Have Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog style:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;front page with recent posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;archive page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written using Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static pages for apps listing, about, contact etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;would-be-nice-features&#34;&gt;Would Be Nice Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disqus commenting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter cards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON Feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching within the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hugo themes page &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;https://themes.gohugo.io&lt;/a&gt; has themes listed by capabilities,
but no way that I could see to combine a selection of capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the features like Google Analytics or Disqus comments, I could probably
add myself using templates from theme that did include them, if the template I
chose did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, nearly all these seem to come with an exampleSite folder that
contains the configuration info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuring-a-theme&#34;&gt;Configuring a Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After testing out several alternatives, I decided to go with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even&#34; title=&#34;Even&#34;&gt;Even&lt;/a&gt; - at
least to start with. I installed the theme and copied the contents of the
example &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; to my own &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file and started configuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with some of the fonts, but soon worked out how to change the CSS
in the theme and then re-build it to apply the changes. And I changed the theme
colour from the default red to &amp;ldquo;Cobalt Blue&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the other changes were done using the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file. I was able to
set up menus, configure the social media links I wanted to show, set date
formats, set the number of items to show per page and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a couple of more static pages that I wanted to show, so I added their
Markdown files to the content folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice feature which I had missed in Jekyll (or at least the way I had it set
up) was the ability to separate blog posts from more static web pages. Each of
my apps has an information/support page that does not accept comments and
doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be listed in the Archives. By moving these Markdown files from
&lt;code&gt;contents/posts&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;contents/pages&lt;/code&gt;, I was able to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding Google Analytics and Disqus commenting was as easy as entering my IDs in
the relevant places in the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to do some editing of my imported posts from Jekyll - mainly getting rid
of references to &lt;code&gt;{{ site.url }}&lt;/code&gt; so that images and internal links would work.
And sometimes I just needed to re-save a file to make Hugo re-evaluate it (there
is probably a command to force a complete re-build if I looked for it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-out-the-structure&#34;&gt;Working out the Structure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I was puzzled by was what templates the various pages are
generated from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main page is easy enough as the theme folder has a layouts folder with an
&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file containing the templating. When a post is displayed, that
looks like it comes from &lt;code&gt;layouts/posts/single.html&lt;/code&gt; while
&lt;code&gt;layouts/posts/summary.html&lt;/code&gt; contains the templating for each entry in the index
page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But clicking on the Archives link in the me takes me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://troz.net/post/&#34;&gt;https://troz.net/post/&lt;/a&gt;
and there is no &lt;code&gt;post.html&lt;/code&gt; file in layouts. There is a &lt;code&gt;post&lt;/code&gt; folder, but it
contains the &lt;code&gt;single.html&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;summary.html&lt;/code&gt; files described already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delving ever deeper, &lt;code&gt;layouts/_default/section.html&lt;/code&gt; appears to contains the
Archives page template. But how does that relate to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://troz.net/post/&#34;&gt;https://troz.net/post/&lt;/a&gt;
link? And the Tags template is in &lt;code&gt;layouts/_default/terms.html&lt;/code&gt; but appears in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://troz.net/tags/&#34;&gt;https://troz.net/tags/&lt;/a&gt;. Checking the Hugo documentation for creating a theme, I
find the information I need. Hugo has a selection of file paths that it checks
for such templates, and these file paths match some of those. So now I know
where to go to customise further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One feature that I really like about the Even theme is the ability to have a
table of contents displayed beside each blog post if your page is wide enough.
It takes the headers in the post and uses them to make the table. I may need to
add or edit the headers in some posts, but I really like this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you want a laugh, test out the 404 page - here is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://troz.net/bad-link/&#34; title=&#34;404&#34;&gt;bad link&lt;/a&gt; - which
generates a random text emoji each time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;publishing&#34;&gt;Publishing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use my existing GitHub Pages setup, so I replaced the site files in
my local repository with the new Hugo site files. I generated the static site
files using &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; in Terminal, then pushed the pages to GitHub. All I had to do
then was change the settings so that GitHub Pages knew my site was coming from
the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; folder and I was live with the new site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how am I going with my check list?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsive - ALMOST, not Hugo&amp;rsquo;s fault&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blog style - YES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written using Markdown - YES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static pages for apps listing, about, contact etc. - YES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting - YES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social links - YES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Analytics - YES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disqus commenting - YES&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter cards - NO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON Feed - NO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching within the site - NO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hugo generated pages are all responsive and look great on my iPhone, but my
old static page for listing my apps does not look good, so I need to re-design
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter cards - I have found some articles on how to set that up, so it is
possible, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JSON Feed is not working. There are themes that apparently have this, but I
haven&amp;rsquo;t yet worked out how to implement it - hopefully later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In-site search - this was something I was able to get in my old WordPress site,
but not in Jekyll. There are Hugo themes listed that support search, but they
seem to just give a link to Google or DuckDuckGo. Maybe this can be edited to
restrict it to the site, but I dislike using such searches, so I will not add a
search unless it works internally. One theme I found uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.algolia.com&#34; title=&#34;Algolia&#34;&gt;Algolia&lt;/a&gt; to search
the site, so I will investigate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am impressed. The transition was relatively easy, especially
considering that I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to learn anything about Hugo first, but
just blundered in and tried to work it out on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speed of generating pages and the live reload while developing make Hugo a
pleasure to work with. Now all I have to do is write some interesting posts&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to tidy up the URLs, headers and tags for the older pages as well as
investigating Twitter cards, search &amp;amp; JSON Feed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Posting from my new iPad</title>
<link>https://troz.net/post/2017/posting-from-my-new-ipad/</link>
<pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2017/posting-from-my-new-ipad/</guid>
<description>

&lt;p&gt;Last week I got a 10.5” iPad Pro. I have had an iPad ever since the original
release, but I have to confess to mainly using it for content consumption rather
than creation. Since I am usually close to a Mac anyway, there didn’t seem a lot
of point. But now that iOS 11 is really addressing the issue of making the iPad
a &amp;ldquo;pro&amp;rdquo; device, I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here I am, sitting in an armchair with my iPad on my lap, writing this post
and working out the details as I go. Any typos are due to the cat trying to
compete with the iPad for space on my lap!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ipad&#34;&gt;iPad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As already mentioned, I have a new iPad Pro. I also have an Apple Pencil which I
use for taking notes. I do not have a keyboard, so I am using the on-screen
keyboard right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t usually install beta versions of operating systems, but iOS 11 is a huge
part of making the iPad more professional, so I have installed it. As you would
expect, there are a few issues (apps quitting, layout issues especially when
rotating) but so far I am loving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing&#34;&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My site is published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; with all the posts
and pages written in Markdown. One key feature is that every post or page
requires a chunk of &amp;ldquo;front matter&amp;rdquo; that must be formatted correctly for the
Jekyll parser to interpret it and create the static content. After a bit of
research, it looked like &lt;a href=&#34;http://omz-software.com/editorial/&#34;&gt;Editorial&lt;/a&gt; was going to be the best option for an
editor app. I moved my site files to Dropbox, linked my Dropbox account to
Editorial and I was ready to start writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t want to create the front matter manually for each post. On my Mac I
have a text expander snippet that handles that but copying from &lt;a href=&#34;http://mattgemmell.com/using-the-ipad-for-blogging-with-jekyll/&#34;&gt;Matt Gemell’s
post&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, I created an Editorial workflow to create a new post. As
a side-note, Matt has a series of posts on using an iPad which I have found very
useful and inspirational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://troz.net/images/Workflow.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Editorial workflow&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text entry and editing is a task that I have always felt was too difficult in
iOS, particularly when it came to selecting text and moving the cursor. However
there are now several improvements. As with iOS 10, a two-fingered press on the
keyboard transforms it into a trackpad for moving the cursor. If you already
have text selected, this moves the selection handles. The new iOS 11 keyboard
has a really nice feature for entering non-alphabetic characters. The keys now
show a small grey character above the main character. Drag down on the key to
move the small character into the main key and type it. For example, drag down
on the h key to type (.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://troz.net/images/keyboard-drag.png&#34; alt=&#34;Keyboard drag&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editorial has its own editing helpers. There is an additional toolbar above the
keyboard with a tab key as well as frequently used Markdown modifiers. And
swiping across this toolbar moves the cursor. This is a much slower move than
when using the keyboard as a trackpad so might be better for more precise
movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-links&#34;&gt;Adding Links:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have referenced a few sites now, so I guess it is time to work out how to link
to them. I always use Markdown’s referenced link method, with the links
collected at the foot of the document, so that is what I plan to do here. To set
text as a link, I selected it and used the Editorial toolbar to type an opening
square bracket which surrounded the selection in square brackets. Then I moved
the cursor to after the closing bracket and typed another opening square
bracket. This auto-closed and I was able to type a number which will be the
reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to find the relevant URLs - drag &amp;amp; drop with multi-tasking to the
rescue! Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to see the new Dock. This also
makes the keyboard disappear. Hold down on the Safari icon until you grab it,
then drag it up into the Editorial window. Now it is open as an overlay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://troz.net/images/safari-overlay.png&#34; alt=&#34;Safari as overlay&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I have several options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swiping from the left or right of the overlay window lets me position it to
the right or left of the screen, still as an overlay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dragging from the bar at the top of the overlap allows me to convert to split
screen mode, and I can then drag the divider to adjust the ratios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swiping all the way to the right disappears the overlay, but swiping back from
the right edge returns it. Since I want to copy and paste some links, this
looks like the best option right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This swiping conflicts slightly with Editorial&amp;rsquo;s swiping from the side to see a
preview. Swipe from off the edge for the overlap and from well inside the edge
for preview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here my plans come crashing down. I can drag from Safari&amp;rsquo;s address bar into
the Editorial document, but the drop doesn’t take. I guess I need an update to
Editorial for this to work. But I can still use the old style copy and paste to
get the links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;images&#34;&gt;Images&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have my links, but I want to insert a few images. I used iOS 11’s new
screen shot abilities. Press the usual home button &amp;amp; power button combination to
take a screen shot and it appears as a small picture in the bottom left of the
screen. Tap it to start editing: markup, crop etc. Then I used the sharing
button to save the picture to Dropbox, putting it inside the images folder in my
web site folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://troz.net/images/screenshot.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Editing a screenshot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to insert an image link but I have just worked out that I saved this
Markdown file in the root folder instead of the _posts folder. I can’t see a way
to move it from inside Editorial, so I will swap to the Dropbox app to move the
file - be right back&amp;hellip; (I see now how I could have done this in Editorial.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this file is in the right place and the images are in the right folder, so
how to add an image link? Checking back at previous posts, I see that the format
I use for inserting an image is: &lt;code&gt;![Alt text][#]&lt;/code&gt; and the reference at the foot
of the page is like&lt;code&gt;[#]: /images/image_name.jpg&lt;/code&gt; but I don’t want to have to
remember that every time, so I think it is time for some snippets. Tapping the
lightning icon on the Editorial keyboard lets me edit and create snippets, so I
have made one for the image link and one for the image reference. Time to scroll
back up the page and try them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened the Dropbox app in an overlay so that I could find the file names for
the images I just saved, then I created the links. The images don’t appear in
the preview but that is expected because Jekyll has not parsed the addresses.
Looking at the information about the images in Dropbox, I see that they are far
too big. I need a way to resize them. The screen shot editor doesn’t have a way
to resize apart from cropping, at least not in this beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://workflow.is/&#34;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt; is another Pro level app that I have never really used, but it
seems that it might do the job. I tried a few workflows to edit the size of an
image from a Dropbox file and save it back, but they although they appeared to
complete, the image file remained the same size. So then I went to the Workflow
Gallery and found a workflow called Quick Resize Screenshot. When editing a
screen shot, I can use the sharing button to run the workflow and then I can
save the smaller images to Dropbox for use in the page. For the large images
that I have already saved, I will resize them on my Mac before publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;publishing&#34;&gt;Publishing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the final step - publishing the changes to GitHub Pages.
Jekyll is a system that creates static web pages from the Markdown and other
files. on my Mac, I run the &lt;code&gt;jekyll build&lt;/code&gt; command in Terminal and the pages are
created or re-generated as required. Then I use &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; to commit my changes and
push them to GitHub which serves them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appear to be Editorial workflows written in Python that use the GitHub
APIs to upload files, but this wouldn’t work well for me. Because of the
structure of my site, many different pages need to be re-generated when I
publish a new post, so I will keep the publishing phase on my Mac. However there
is no need to make it any more difficult than necessary, so I have written a
shell script to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script takes an optional commit message parameter, builds the site, commits
changes and pushes then to GitHub. I have only tested this when no files had
changed, so this post will be the first real test. Shell scripting is outside my
comfort zone, so we will have to see how that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have a workflow on my iPad that uses Editorial, Dropbox and Workflow.
This allows me to do 100% of the writing task. Then I have a single shell script
on my Mac that does the publishing part. I can edit and create posts anywhere. I
can easily use split screen or screen overlays to add links. iOS 11 makes
creating and annotating screen shots very easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am hoping for an update to Editorial that will allow it to accept drag &amp;amp; drop.
The ability to resize screen shots before saving them would also be really
useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes my posts are more code-based and need access to Xcode and in those
cases, I will stick to my Mac, especially considering Xcode’s new ability to
connect directly to GitHub which will make it great for publishing Swift
playgrounds. But for more narrative-style posts like this one, I will use my
iPad and see how I can improve my workflow and expand my tool set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels good to be using the iPad as a content creation device at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extra-notes-from-a-mac&#34;&gt;Extra Notes from a Mac:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this was my first time writing a blog post using an iPad and this
workflow, I decided that I should test the results before publishing, so I
switched back to the Mac and in Terminal, ran &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; so that I could see
the results. There were a few issues mainly to do with the formatting of the
front matter. The three dashes at the top &amp;amp; bottom of the front matter had
become munged into an emdash plus a dash, so that didn’t work. Jekyll is also
fussy about the spaces in the tag &amp;amp; summary lines and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t handle
non-alphanumerics in the summary text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also used the Mac to shrink some of the images that I had saved before working
out how to reduce the size of screen shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I need to check the structure of the front matter workflow before next time,
but this post is ready to go with only minor editing on the Mac side. Now to
test my shell script&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Testing automation</title>
<link>https://troz.net/post/2015/testing-automation/</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2015/testing-automation/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I am experimenting with automating post generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, there is the structure of the post Markdown document, which really
boils down to the file name and the header.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have set up a macro in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/&#34;&gt;Typinator&lt;/a&gt; so that I just type the title of the
post in a text document. I copy that title to the clipboard and type the
shortcut. The header is then created with the title and the formatted permalink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save the document, I use another Typinator snippet to convert the title
(still in the clipboard) to lower case and to replace the spaces in the title
with dashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starting the local Jekyll server, I have turned to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alfredapp.com&#34;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; workflow.
I have two actions in the workflow. One opens Terminal, cd&amp;rsquo;s to my site folder
and runs the command to start the local Jekyll server. The second opens my
default browser to the local Jekyll test address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both these actions happen simultaneously so the browser usually fails until
refreshed. The server is left running in Terminal so I can shut it down when
finished testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After writing the post, the final stage is to publish, so I need to work out the
commands for doing a git commit and push. Then I should be able to automate
those tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing the git commands using Terminal, I have come up with the following
sequence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit -a -m &amp;quot;Commit message here&amp;quot;
git push
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commit message could be the title of the post, so I need a way to construct
the command and then execute it. Typinator is good at text manipulation, so I
constructed another macro that takes the clipboard, uses it as the commit
message and performs the git commands. This gave a good commit message, but the
actual commit failed, so that was no use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then I went back to Alfred and created a workflow there with a series of
Terminal commands to perform the actions above. This only allows a generic
commit message, but it works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there is still room for improvement, but with a set of macros, I can automate
a lot of the standard text entry, which is always good for reducing errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequence now is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the text editor and type the title of the post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut this into the clipboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the Typinator macro to fill in the post header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the post file, using the Typinator macro to construct the file name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the post, then use an Alfred workflow to test it locally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When ready, use an Alfred workflow to publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

<title>Workflow for writing a post</title>
<link>https://troz.net/post/2015/workflow-for-writing-a-post/</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://troz.net/post/2015/workflow-for-writing-a-post/</guid>
<description>&lt;p&gt;So here is where I need to get used to Jekyll and how things are done. I will
end up automating this when I am sure of the process, but for now, I am just
going to work my way through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start up the local Jekyll server:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I opened Terminal and used &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to get to the folder containing my site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next I started the Jekyll server locally using &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This gave me the address of the local server - in my case
&lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1:4000/&lt;/code&gt; - so I went there in my browser to see the default
page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My goal is to write a new blog post (this one in fact).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For advice on creating a new post, I went to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/&#34;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jekyll needs the file name to be a specific format which includes the date
and title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; folder of the site folder, I see the previous post
file is titled &lt;code&gt;2015-03-08-new-site-for-trozware.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As it is now 10th March 2015, I am saving this file as:
&lt;code&gt;2015-03-10-workflow-for-writing-a-post.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saving at this point shows a Jekyll error in the Terminal, but the next
stage will fix that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front matter:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jekyll specifies that each file must have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&#34;&gt;front matter block&lt;/a&gt; in a
certain format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The header has certain essential parameters and then more optional ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My site was imported from WordPress, so the older posts contain several
header parameters that may not be necessary any more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the screen shot below to see what I have in this post file:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After saving, I see this entry in my Terminal:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Regenerating: 1 file(s) changed at 2015-03-10 13:50:40 ...done in 0.421789
seconds.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now I can see the title and the start of the post on my first page and when
clicking on it, I can see all the text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adding an image:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not really necessary for this post, but I wanted to document it as
part of the workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wanted to show the front matter and start of this post, so I took a
screen shot of the top of my editor window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then I renamed the image file and moved it into the &lt;code&gt;images&lt;/code&gt; folder of my
site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now to embed the image using this Markdown: &lt;code&gt;![Post header][2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you can see, I prefer to group all links (images &amp;amp; URLs) at the end of
the document and keep the body of the text as clean as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://troz.net/images/post_header.png&#34; alt=&#34;Post header&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proofing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that I have the text of my post, I need to proof-read it from the local
Jekyll server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; command running in Terminal keeps the pages up-to-date
as you edit, but you will need to refresh your page in the browser manually
to check your changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I have found that if you make a major change to the site e.g. a CSS
file or a config file, then it is best to stop the Jekyll server and start
it again to make it re-build all the files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be completely sure, stop the server and run &lt;code&gt;jekyll build&lt;/code&gt; in Terminal
although this may only do what &lt;code&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; does on startup anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now it is time to publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I am using GitHub Pages to host, the site files are all part of a single
Git repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And as I understand it, the data &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be in the &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; branch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opening up the GitHub client, I see that my repository has a bunch of
changes: - the file I am working on - the image I inserted - feed.xml -
index.html files for each page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is as expected, since all pages are pre-generated when using Jekyll,
so pages of posts must be re-rendered when a new post is added to the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that several of the files appear twice: once from where they are
edited and once from the _site folder which serves them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just two simple steps now, using the GitHub client: 1. Commit 2. Sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it. My new post is online and ready for reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was my first post after the one I wrote when setting up, so the first
real post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While there appear to be a lot of steps, none of them are difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But I do have 4 apps running to do it: 1. TextWrangler for editing 1.
Terminal to run the local Jekyll server 1. Safari to check the finished
post 1. GitHub to commit and upload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automating this is an obvious next step, so stay tuned&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
