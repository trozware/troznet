      <description>So here is where I need to get used to Jekyll and how things are done. I will end up automating this when I am sure of the process, but for now, I am just going to work my way through it.

      <description>For some time now, I have been aware of the increasing trend towards using Markdown for text editing and for creating HTML. Markdown has been on my list of &amp;ldquo;things I should learn some day&amp;rdquo; so I was interested last week to read about a new iBooks book called The MacSparky Markdown Field Guide. This was sufficient inspiration so I got the book and read through it this weekend.</description>
