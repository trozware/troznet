&amp;ldquo;A Knight&amp;rsquo;s Move&amp;rdquo; is a fun, addictive and simple puzzle game based on the movements of chess pieces. Your goal is to move your white knight across a board to a target square using the same movements as a knight in chess. Pawns may block your way, while enemy bishops, castles, knights and the queen may try to stop you.</description>
