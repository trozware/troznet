      <description>Time In Words for iOS started off as a fun gimmick, emulating the Qlocktwo type of time display where the relevant words are highlighted in some way to spell out the time as a sentence. This very quickly evolved into what I hoped would be more useful app, still showing the original display, but also providing the current time &amp;amp; date as complete sentences. Then I added time conversions and discovered the real power and utility of writing out times as words.</description>

      <description>Time In Words screen saver has just been updated to version 1.1 and is now fully compatible with Mountain Lion. It is free to use and can be downloaded here.
The basic screen saver worked before, but searching for an alternative time zone would crash System Preferences. That is now fixed.
The screen saver also shows a thumbnail image when in Mountain Lion and is code-signed with my developer ID for compatibility with Mountain Lion&amp;rsquo;s Gatekeeper.</description>

      <description>Having just completed the my first screen saver for Mac - the Time In Words Screen Saver, I thought I would share some of the experiences. I am using OS X Lion (10.7) and Xcode 4.3.2
The first thing is to create a new project in Xcode using the Screen Saver template:

Xcode sets up a project for you with everything you need for a screen saver module. Start editing the ScreenSaverView.</description>

      <description>The new iPad has a Retina display, meaning that the pixel density is much greater. For some apps, this is a problem as their graphics are now scaled and look pixellated. However Time In Words is very simple. It uses standard fonts and interface widgets with no images or external graphics apart from the icon. The icon may not look perfect on a new iPad, but the display itself should look really great.</description>

      <title>Interface options for selecting time zones</title>

      <description>As part of the design for [Time In Words for Mac][1], I had to work out the interface for selecting time zones. With [Time In Word for iOS][2], I used picker wheels which are excellent for selecting hierarchical data. On the Mac, there is no such thing as the iOS picker wheel and so I had to consider what to use instead.
When you ask the system (Mac or iOS) for the available time zones, you get a list of names like this:</description>

Time In Words is a clock and calendar app that takes you out of the digital era and back to when saying “quarter to seven” or “five past two” was accurate enough.
