      <description>I have started work updating my iOS apps to fill the larger screen of an iPhone
 My iPhone 5 is on order - I missed out on the first shipment, but hopefully it won&amp;rsquo;t be too long. Meanwhile, I will just test in the iPhone Simulator and hope this is OK.  But it was a puzzle to me how to get an app to fill the longer screen. I have the latest Xcode and the latest Simulator which allows you to specify what screen size iPhone to simulate.</description>

      <description>In Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), Apple decided to make it more difficult to access your Library folder, presumably to stop people doing stuff that made apps crash. But as a developer, I need access to my Library folder a lot. I need to check that preferences are being saved correctly. If I have an app that uses the Application Support folder, then I need to be able to check it.</description>

      <title>Support for older operating systems</title>

      <description>Working out what operating systems to support in your software is always a difficult decision. I only program for Mac &amp;amp; iOS systems for starters. This is because they are the systems I use and understand. I am not interested in expending the time &amp;amp; money needed to program and test my software for other systems.
Within the Mac &amp;amp; iOS ecosystems, there is still the decision of which versions to support.</description>
