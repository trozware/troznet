      <title>JSON Feed for TrozWare</title>

      <description>jsonfeed.org has announced a new format for web site feeds, designed as an alternative to RSS. TrozWare has had an XML RSS feed for years, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone ever uses it (I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t), so today I have replaced it with a JSON feed, which you can access through the  button at the top of every page.
I am sure many JSON Feed viewers will appear soon, but the only one I know about so far is at http://json-feed-viewer.</description>

      <title>New Site for TrozWare</title>

      <description>Welcome to TrozWare&amp;rsquo;s new site. It appears that I am not alone in deciding to move away from WordPress. WordPress is great - easy to set up and with lots of cool themes to allow customisation of your site. But it is slow, especially if (like me) you are running on a low-cost shared server.
I had been reading about Jekyll, so I decide to give it a go and also host my site on GitHub, taking advantage of their faster servers.</description>
