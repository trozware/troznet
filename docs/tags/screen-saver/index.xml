      <description>Time In Words screen saver has just been updated to version 1.1 and is now fully compatible with Mountain Lion. It is free to use and can be downloaded here.
The basic screen saver worked before, but searching for an alternative time zone would crash System Preferences. That is now fixed.
The screen saver also shows a thumbnail image when in Mountain Lion and is code-signed with my developer ID for compatibility with Mountain Lion&amp;rsquo;s Gatekeeper.</description>
