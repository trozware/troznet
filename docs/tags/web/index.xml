      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I came to update my blog: I had a new post in draft form and I wanted
to update the Swift code to version 4. However installing High Sierra had
removed &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com&#34; title=&#34;Jekyll&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; which is the site generator that I had been using. I
re-installed Jekyll but found that it had been updated from version 2 to version
3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Today I am experimenting with automating post generation.
Firstly, there is the structure of the post Markdown document, which really boils down to the file name and the header.
I have set up a macro in Typinator so that I just type the title of the post in a text document. I copy that title to the clipboard and type the shortcut. The header is then created with the title and the formatted permalink.</description>

      <description>So here is where I need to get used to Jekyll and how things are done. I will end up automating this when I am sure of the process, but for now, I am just going to work my way through it.
 Start up the local Jekyll server:
 I opened Terminal and used cd to get to the folder containing my site. Next I started the Jekyll server locally using jekyll serve.</description>

      <title>New Site for TrozWare</title>

      <description>Welcome to TrozWare&amp;rsquo;s new site. It appears that I am not alone in deciding to move away from WordPress. WordPress is great - easy to set up and with lots of cool themes to allow customisation of your site. But it is slow, especially if (like me) you are running on a low-cost shared server.
I had been reading about Jekyll, so I decide to give it a go and also host my site on GitHub, taking advantage of their faster servers.</description>
