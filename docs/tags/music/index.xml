<description>&lt;p&gt;So my latest app is way outside my usual sphere but that&amp;rsquo;s what happens when
family decide that what you do might actually be useful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My son is an oboist and he is currently learning Berio&amp;rsquo;s Sequenza VII for Oboe.
This is a weird piece without a standard time signature. Instead each line has
13 bars with each bar being allocated a certain time span in actual seconds. As
can easily be imagined, this makes learning and practicing this piece more of a
mathematical exercise than a musical one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wrote him an app to sound out the end of each bar. Once he and his teacher
used it, a few more features crept in and now I think it will be of great
assistance to any student or teacher trying to work on this piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I doubt that many oboists frequent this web site, it anyone who does can
pass this on to any oboist, I would be very grateful, and I think the oboist
would be too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is available through the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sequenza-vii/id730234638?mt=8&amp;uo=4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iTunes
App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
More details are on &lt;a href=&#34;https://troz.net/berio/&#34; title=&#34;Berio’s Sequenza VII&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
