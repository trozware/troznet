      <description>So my latest app is way outside my usual sphere but that&amp;rsquo;s what happens when family decide that what you do might actually be useful!
My son is an oboist and he is currently learning Berio&amp;rsquo;s Sequenza VII for Oboe. This is a weird piece without a standard time signature. Instead each line has 13 bars with each bar being allocated a certain time span in actual seconds. As can easily be imagined, this makes learning and practicing this piece more of a mathematical exercise than a musical one.</description>

      <title>Berio&#39;s Sequenza VII</title>

      <description>Luciano Berio wrote a series of Sequenzas for various instruments with Sequenza VII being the one for oboe.
Preparing this work creates some unique problems for the oboist as Berio did not adhere to any time signature that could be indicated by a metronome. Instead, each line consists of 13 bars (measures) with each bar&amp;rsquo;s length specified in exact seconds.
When my son (an oboist currently studying in Melbourne, Australia) started trying to learn this piece, it occurred to him that having an iOS app developer in the family could be of some assistance.</description>
