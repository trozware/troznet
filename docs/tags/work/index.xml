Work requires macOS 10.12 or OS X 10.11 and will be available from the Mac App Store soon.
We all know what it is like to be in the middle of a project or rushing to complete an assignment&amp;hellip;
We have files scattered all over the place, email addresses of team members or clients, web pages with specifications or useful information, tasks scribbled on sticky notes or scraps of paper.</description>
