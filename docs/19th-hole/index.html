<p>19th Hole is the golf scoring app for everyone, and it is available from the
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-19th-hole/id871686159?mt=8&uo=4" target="itunes_store">iTunes
App Store</a>.</p>

<p>Whether you are playing for the club championship, having a weekend round with
friends or playing pitch&rsquo;n&rsquo;putt with the kids, 19th Hole makes it easy to keep
score.</p>

<p>Designed for fast, accurate score keeping with a color scheme chosen for optimal
outdoor viewing, 19th Hole uses a simple setup process and an intuitive,
gesture-based score entry system. During and after the round, you can see totals
and results using various methods: total strokes, total putts, match play (Irish
match play for more than 2 players) &amp; Stableford.</p>

<p>19th Hole now includes an Apple Watch app so strokes can be entered quickly and
easily using the watch to avoid having to pull your iPhone out of your bag.</p>

<p>When you have finished, you can archive the score card for future reference and
email the completed card to your fellow players.</p>

<h2 id="scoring-a-round-is-very-simple">Scoring a round is very simple:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Select a course - the last played course is pre-selected.</li>
<li>Select the players - the last set of players is pre-selected.</li>
<li>Tap &lsquo;Start Round&rsquo;</li>
<li>Optionally enter the players&rsquo; handicaps - the last used handicaps are
pre-selected.</li>
<li>After each hole, enter the strokes played by each person, on your iPhone or
Apple Watch.</li>
<li>You can also record putts and various other statistics (iPhone only).</li>
</ol>

<br>iPhone</p>

<p><img title="Watch Scoring" alt="Watch Scoring" src="/images/19thHole-Watch-v3.jpg" />
<br>Apple Watch</p>

<p>Courses only need to be entered once and are then saved for future use.<br />
Enter the course name, number of holes and select the tees in use. For each hole,
enter the par, index/handicap, and the distance from each tee.</p>

<p>If you are in a hurry to start the round, enter the name of the course and the
number of holes. The rest of the data can be entered for each hole as you play,
or can be edited later.</p>

<p><img src="/images/19-3_4-500.png" alt="Adding a course" /></p>

<p>Players can be selected from your Contacts or entered manually. Add email
addresses so the completed cards can be emailed after the round. Choose an icon
for each player. If a player was selected from Contacts, you can use the photo
assigned in the Contacts app.</p>

<p><img src="/images/19-4_4-500.png" alt="Adding a player" /></p>

<h2 id="gesture-controlled">Gesture-controlled:</h2>

<p>All scores are entered using a special number button that you tap, then drag
your finger up or down the screen to raise or lower the number.</p>

<p>Hold your finger down on the number, then move it up or down to change the
number displayed. To make it easier to see what you are doing, hold your finger
down on the number, then first drag to one side before dragging up or down. Play
the video below to see how this works.</p>

</video>

<p><br>
To change hole, swipe left or right in the lower half of the screen, below the line. Swiping back from hole 1 allows you to change the handicaps. Swiping on from the last hole takes you to Notes where you can record any interesting events during this round.</p>

<p>During a round, cumulative statistics are shown at the bottom of the screen.<br />
For a more complete score card, you can swipe downwards in the middle of the screen.</p>

<p>Tap on the hole details at the top of the screen to edit that data.</p>

<h2 id="after-the-game">After the game:</h2>

<p>While relaxing at &ldquo;The 19th Hole&rdquo; after the game, you can check the scores and
swipe back and forth between holes to see what happened during the round.</p>

<p>Once you are sure the scores are correct, tap the &ldquo;Action&rdquo; button in the top
right. You can add some notes to the round at this point or archive the round so
that the completed score card is saved on your iPhone. After this, you will not
be able to make any further changes.</p>

<p>Completed rounds are listed when you tap &ldquo;See Old Cards&rdquo; with the most recent at
the top. Tap one to see the complete score card for that round. Tap &ldquo;Strokes&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Putts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stableford&rdquo; to change what is shown for each hole. The summary is
shown at the bottom.</p>
