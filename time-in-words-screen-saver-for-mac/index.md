The latest member of the Time In Words suite of apps is a screen saver module for Macs.  
Version 1.2 updated January 2013: compatible with Lion (OS X 10.7), Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8), Mavericks (OS X 10.9) & Yosemite (OS X 10.10).

Like [Time In Words for iOS][7] and [World Time In Words for Mac][8], it displays the time and date in plain words which are easy to read and comprehend. While it only shows a single time and date, this can be configured to show your local time & date or any available time zone. Since the App Store does not have a section for screen savers, the [Time In Words screen saver][9] is available as a direct download from my site. Click the link or the icon above to download the screen saver as a zip file. If the zip file does not open automatically, double-click the file to unzip it. Then double-click the "Time In Words Screen Saver.saver" file to install the screen saver in your System Preferences. You will be asked whether you want to install it for the current user only or for all users. Selecting "All Users" will require you to enter your password, so I recommend just installing for the current user. 

Scroll to the "Other" section of the list of screen savers and click "Time In Words Screen Saver" to activate it. Sometimes the installation leaves the screen saver selected but not active. If this is the case, select another screen saver and then click back on Time In Words.

By default, your local time & date will be displayed. To select a different time zone, click the "Screen Saver Optionsâ€¦" button to display the following:

Click the &#8220;Show Alternate Time&#8221; radio button to enable the time zone list. As with Time In Words for Mac, you can type part of a city name in the search field to find a zone quickly. Select the zone you want to use and click &#8220;OK&#8221;. The preview will switch to showing your newly selected time zone.

For anyone interested in the source code, here is a download link: [Time In Words Screen Saver Xcode project][10]. This was written using Xcode 4.x so is rather out-dated by now, but may prove useful to others wishing to start writing their own screens savers.
