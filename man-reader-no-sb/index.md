If you find that Man Reader is not working well for you due to Apple&#8217;s sandboxing restrictions, then you can download a non-sandboxed version here. To find out more about this, including how to test if you are affected, read the [Sand-Boxing Man Reader][1] page.

**The non-sandboxed version will only work if you have the App Store version of Man Reader already installed.**

When you run &#8216;Man Reader (no SB)&#8217; for the first time, it will check to see if you have a valid installation of &#8216;Man Reader&#8217; that you have purchased from the App Store.  
If you do not, &#8216;Man Reader (no SB)&#8217; will offer to take you to the App Store and then quit.

If you already own the App Store version of Man Reader and &#8216;Man Reader (no SB)&#8217; has started once, you can delete the App Store version and &#8216;Man Reader (no SB)&#8217; will keep working.

To install &#8216;Man Reader (no SB)&#8217;, click the download link below. This will download &#8216;ManReader-noSB.zip&#8217;. Double-click on this file to un-zip it, and then move the &#8216;Man Reader (no SB).app&#8217; into your Applications folder and use as normal. Do not delete the App Store version of Man Reader until &#8216;Man Reader (no SB)&#8217; has been run at least once.
