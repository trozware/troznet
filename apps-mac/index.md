### A Knight&#8217;s Move:

A Knight&#8217;s Move is a puzzle game where you have to move your knight across a board to a target square using the same movements as a knight in chess. Pawns may block your way, while enemy bishops, castles, knights and the queen may try to stop you.

Get from the starting position to the target in the shortest possible number of moves. Score stars based on the moves taken.

When you have tried all the supplied puzzles or if you want something different, more game packs can be purchased from within the app.

### Dice Pass:

Dice Pass is a utility to app to generate random passphrases based on the Diceware system. Diceware uses a table of pre-defined words, each assigned a 5 digit code number containing the digits 1 to 6. The official way to generate a phrase is to roll 5 dice for each word you want in your passphrase and then consult the words table to find the matching word. Dice Pass does this for you.
